“ i live out by o ’ hare . every time a plane flies overhead at night , my hands shake . i ’ m looking for a place to hide . and then the sirens too – the police and ambulance sirens . i know they ’ re not there , but it feels like soldiers are just outside the windows . we used to watch them walk up and down the road by my grandparents ’ house , and we weren ’ t to say anything . they ’ d harass everyone , beat people up , including my grandpa . we were supposed to stay inside . my cousin was killed ,” my patient told me last november during a psychotherapy session in chicago , home to the largest population of palestinian people in the united states . “ i haven ’ t felt like this , had nightmares like this , since i was a kid .”
