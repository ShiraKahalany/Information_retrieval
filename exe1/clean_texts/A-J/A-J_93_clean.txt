hospitals are supposed to be immune from attack in times of war but israel has repeatedly bombed and shelled them since october 7 , 2023 . this film looks at israel ’ s destruction of gaza ’ s hospitals in the context of its historical expansion at the expense of the palestinian population , going back to 1948 . the israeli army cut off water , power , fuel and medical supplies to gaza and has attacked most of its hospitals . it claims that al - shifa hospital shielded a hamas command centre and attacked it despite the hundreds of civilians sheltering there – but produced little evidence to support that claim . the alleged war crimes that the international criminal court is seeking arrest warrants for on both sides include israel ’ s deliberate targeting of civilians , many of whom have taken shelter in gaza ’ s hospitals .
