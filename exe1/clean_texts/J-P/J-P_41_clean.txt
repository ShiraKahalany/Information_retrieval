Home for Palestinian Barakat Mour is a hillside cave in the West Bank , which he says is often under threat from Israeli settlers in the territory .
& quot ; You @@@ ll be sitting with your wife in the cave and the settlers will raid it without any notice ,& quot ; Mour , 60 , told Reuters about his family @@@ s dwelling near the West Bank city of Hebron .
& quot ; Here is where I was born . I was born in this cave . Homeland is very dear and my land is very dear to me , it is part of me ,& quot ; he said .
The Israeli military said that in recent weeks & quot ; there have been several reports of friction between settlers and Palestinians in caves near the village of ( At - Tuwani )& quot ; and that troops worked to & quot ; separate the participants and restore order .& quot ;
Natural caves dot the southern Hebron hills . According to the Israeli rights group B @@@ Tselem , Palestinian cave - dwellers have been living there at least since the 1830s , using some caves as shelter for sheep and goats and others as homes .
Most have openings carved from stone and are divided into a living space , a storage area and a kitchen .
Mour and his 12 brothers live in the Palestinian village of Yatta , but spend most days in a cave and rotate sleeping there to deter settlers from seizing it at night , he said .
Mour said that in one incident last week around 70 settlers entered the cave and damaged property .
Some 440 , 000 settlers live among more than 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank , territory Israel captured in the 1967 Six Day War and that Palestinians seek for a future state .
Israeli and Palestinian activists have staged demonstrations outside the cave to support Mour @@@ s family .
At one recent protest , on Jan . 23 , activists banged drums and chanted & quot ; occupation , no more & quot ; towards a group of settlers before being dispersed by Israeli troops firing stun grenades .
The military said & quot ; a disturbance developed & quot ; during which a number of Palestinians violated an order to leave the area , resulting in soldiers employing & quot ; riot dispersal means .& quot ;
