The Israel - based NGO International Legal Forum ( ILF ) has called on UNICEF to investigate allegations of Palestinian children being trained as child soldiers in Gaza , following & nbsp ; a report by & nbsp ; The Jerusalem Post .
& nbsp ;
The NGO , which is a network of over 3 , 000 lawyers and activists in over 40 nations worldwide , stated that they have & quot ; grave concern & quot ; following reports that the Gaza - based Palestinian terrorist groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) were training and recruiting children .

Arsen Ostrovsky , director of ILF , told The Post that UNICEF @@@ s ongoing failure to act on this issue is an & nbsp ;& quot ; unconscionable dereliction of duty in its central mission to protect and defend children @@@ s rights .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
As reported by the & nbsp ; Post , Hamas announced in late June its annual summer camp , where it trains children to take up arms .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
According to & nbsp ; Post & nbsp ; analyst Seth J . Frantzman , the terrorist group says the youth need to be ready to make & ldquo ; sacrifices ,& rdquo ; which appears to be the language used to describe recruiting them to be killed . The speech by Hamas members said the camps include religious indoctrination and & ldquo ; security & rdquo ; training .
& nbsp ;
An English video was released by Hamas with an explanation that it intended to & quot ; prepare the youth ,& quot ; calling the summer camps & quot ; training camps & quot ; that were named after the & quot ; Sword of al - Quds ( Sword of Jerusalem ).& quot ; This is the term they used to refer to the & nbsp ; 11 - day Hamas - Israel conflict in May , dubbed by the IDF as Operation Guardian of the Walls .
& nbsp ;
As reported by & nbsp ; Post & nbsp ; correspondent Khaled Abu Toameh , around 50 , 000 children had registered .
& nbsp ;
The & nbsp ; Meir Amit Intelligence Terrorism Information Center & nbsp ; published a report that at least one Palestinian child killed in Gaza during the conflict was a member of Hamas . This is especially notable , as an entire front - page story in & nbsp ; The New York Times & nbsp ; with photos of each child killed in Gaza during the conflict drew significant attention .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
UNICEF , the UN agency responsible for humanitarian and developmental aid for children , has stated that recruiting child soldiers violates international humanitarian laws .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Thousands of children are recruited and used in armed conflicts across the world . Often referred to as & lsquo ; child soldiers ,& rsquo ; these boys and girls suffer extensive forms of exploitation and abuse that are not fully captured by that term ,& rdquo ; UNICEF @@@ s website states .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Warring parties use children not only as fighters but as scouts , cooks , porters , guards , messengers and more . Many , especially girls , are also subjected to gender - based violence ,& quot ; it said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Children become part of an armed force or group for various reasons ,& quot ; the website explained . & quot ; Some are abducted , threatened , coerced or manipulated by armed actors . Others are driven by poverty , compelled to generate income for their families . Still others associate themselves for survival or to protect their communities . No matter their involvement , the recruitment and use of children by armed forces is a grave violation of child rights and international humanitarian law .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The ILF released a statement including a selection of pictures from the training camp showing children receiving & quot ; military terror training & quot ; by PIJ and Hamas .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; Hamas and PIJ are committing a war crime under customary and treaty international law as appears in the Rome Statute ( Article 2 ( b )( xxvi ) and Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child regarding the involvement of children in armed conflict , inter alia ,& quot ; the statement reads .
& nbsp ;
The citing of the Rome Statute is notable , as it is under this jurisdiction that the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) has launched a war crimes probe into both Israel and Hamas for their 2014 conflict , Operation Protective Edge .
& nbsp ;
According to International Legal Forum advocate Russell Shalev , & quot ; As an organization committed to protecting and defending child rights , it is incumbent upon UNICEF to act immediately and without reservation to prevent the continuation of such unconscionable atrocities and abuse of children in Gaza , as well as to hold Palestinian terror groups Hamas and PIJ , accountable for these heinous crimes .& quot ;& nbsp ;
