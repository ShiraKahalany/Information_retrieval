On Tuesday , the Jordan River crossings ( Kasser Al - Yahud ) hosted an event commemorating the historic crossing of the Jordan River by the Israelites approximately 3 , 300 years ago . Led by the Jordan Valley Trustees Association , the ceremony not only honored a significant moment in Israel & rsquo ; s history but also underscored the association & rsquo ; s call to recognize the Jordan River crossings as a national heritage site and reaffirm Israeli sovereignty in the Jordan Valley . Brig .- Gen . ( Ret .) Uzi Dayan , chairman of the Jordan Valley Trustees Association , emphasized the importance of preserving historical sites such as the Jordan River crossings and highlighted their profound significance in connecting the Jewish people to the Land of Israel .& ldquo ; The site symbolizes the deep and historical connection of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel ,& rdquo ; Dayan stated , advocating for an annual state ceremony to commemorate the Israelites & rsquo ; crossing . The event drew participation from hundreds of individuals across the country who engaged in various activities , including a musical prayer service , guided tours in the Jericho area , and a symposium discussing the historical and cultural significance of the Jordan River crossings . Collaborating with regional councils in the Jordan Valley and receiving support from organizations such as Magen David Adom , the Aliyah and Integration Ministry , the World Zionist Organization , and the Jordan Valley Trustees Association highlighted the potential for developing tourism in the region . Dayan noted that the site attracts over 850 , 000 tourists annually and proposed the construction of hotels and visitor centers to accommodate the growing interest , which could provide employment opportunities for residents and further establish Israel & rsquo ; s presence in the Jordan Valley . The Jordan River crossing is a cornerstone moment for the Israeli peopleAccording to biblical accounts and historical research , the crossing of the Jordan River by the Hebrews or Israelites is a pivotal moment in their journey to claim the Promised Land . As recounted in the Book of Joshua , after wandering in the wilderness for forty years , the Israelites , led by Joshua , stood on the eastern bank of the Jordan River , poised to enter the land of Canaan . Mirroring the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea led by Moses , Joshua ordered the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant to step into the waters of the Jordan . As they did , the river miraculously parted , allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground , just as the slave generation had done 40 years earlier . This event symbolized the fulfillment of God & rsquo ; s promise to deliver the land to the Israelites and marked the beginning of their conquest and settlement of Canaan . Historical research corroborates elements of this biblical account , suggesting that the crossing of the Jordan River likely occurred at a shallow ford near the modern - day site of Kasser Al - Yahud . Archaeological evidence and geographical studies support the plausibility of such an event , with scholars proposing that the timing of the crossing coincided with the spring thaw when the river & rsquo ; s waters would have been at their lowest .
