Magen David Adom ( MDA ) medics and paramedics provided medical treatment to a 19 - year - old soldier , and transferred him to Ashkelon @@@ s Barzilai Medical Center in stable condition with a shrapnel wound to his upper body , after another barrage of rockets slammed the region surrounding the Gaza Strip and southern Israel on Tuesday afternoon .
& nbsp ;
The soldier @@@ s unit was overseeing the distribution of humanitarian aid to the Strip , as Israel reopened the Kerem Shalom border crossing to allow for the transfer of gas , food and medicine to Gazan residents .
& nbsp ;
The IDF said that the mortars struck as a convoy of trucks carrying aid donated by international aid organizations was crossing into the coastal enclave . At least one mortar shell hit the Erez Crossing while several others were fired at the Kerem Shalom Crossing . Following the attack , the IDF suspended the entry of the rest of the trucks .
& nbsp ;
The border was closed & nbsp ; last Sunday & nbsp ; when police arrested 15 stone - throwers near the crossing .& nbsp ;


The stone - throwing was part of sweeping unrest across the southern Levant , in which there was intense rioting in the Old City of Jerusalem , and consequent rocket fire from the Gaza Strip .
& nbsp ;
The border was last closed by Israel & nbsp ; in August , when rocket fire and incendiary balloons from the coastal enclave barraged Israel @@@ s southern communities . At the time , it remained open for essential humanitarian aid and fuel , as was supposed to be the case again now .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Kerem Shalom is Gaza @@@ s main commercial crossing into Israel , and as such , its closing is reflective of the level of intensity that the escalations have reached .& nbsp ;

Since the onset of the renewed conflict , twelve people in Israel have lost their lives from direct rocket fire .

Some 105 Israelis have been injured by shrapnel , an additional 194 while sprinting to bomb shelters and 218 more were treated for symptoms of post - traumatic stress , according to MDA .
