Arab Israeli activist Yoseph Haddad has taken on the task of exposing the horrors that occurred on the morning of Saturday , October 7 , a role that many government officials have neglected . Speaking to Arabs in their own language , Haddad explains the implications of Hamas ' s surprise attack . In a prime time segment on Channel 12 , Haddad directly addressed Hamas in Arabic , saying , " Let ' s speak Arabic . Do you want to go on like this ? OK then ... Israel will prevail ! The people of Israel will prevail . You don ' t have the support of the Israeli Arabs ! Get it into your heads ! You are terrorists ! You are ISIS - Hamas , that ' s who you are ! And the whole world will know you are ISIS - Hamas !" Yoseph Haddad : Hamas , you are on your way to hell ! He continued , " Long live Israel , long live the people of Israel , long live the State of Israel ! Let ' s see you after you go to hell !" Just a few days earlier , Haddad shared a video clip of his visit to Tel Aviv University , where he confronted students waving Palestinian flags , asking them , why they were studying at Tel Aviv University , telling them to go and study in Jenin . The video quickly went viral on social networks , amassing tens of thousands of views and comments from Israeli and Arab users worldwide . Among the comments , one Arab user wrote that they think exactly like Haddad . Another comment read , " Free Palestine ," accompanied by the Palestinian Authority flag . The Jerusalem Post and OneFamily are working together to help support the victims of the Hamas massacre and the soldiers of Israel who have been drafted to ensure that it never happens again .& nbsp ; Become a partner in this project by donating to OneFamily & gt ;& gt ;
