She said , & ldquo ; This is his Haggadah , allowing him to follow along during the seder with ease and familiarity , as he is very well acquainted with the format of the Haggadah . It also allows him to be able to actually read certain pages and sections out loud - making him feel even more included at the Pesach seder .& rdquo ; A testament to our inclusivity & nbsp ;" Our interactive Haggadah is a testament to our unwavering commitment to inclusivity ," said Michael Lawrence , Chief Advancement Officer at Beit Issie Shapiro .
