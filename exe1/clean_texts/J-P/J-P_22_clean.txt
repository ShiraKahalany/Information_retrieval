Israel and the US have targeted Iranian - backed forces in Syria over the last several days , according to reports . The airstrikes on Sunday evening triggered Syrian air defense , according to Iranian regime media . The strikes may have been in response to an attack on an Israeli - owned vessel in the Gulf of Oman .
& nbsp ;
Last week , in response to an attack on US military forces in Iraq , the US also carried out airstrikes in Syria . The US said that President Joe Biden had ordered the strikes against Iranian - backed militant groups in eastern Syria . The strikes were authorized as a response to attacks against American and coalition personnel in Iraq .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Specifically , the strikes destroyed multiple facilities located at a border control point used by a number of Iranian - backed military groups , including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al - Shuhada ,& rdquo ; the US said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It was a deliberate and planned retaliation ,& rdquo ; the US said in an unambiguous message , adding that it would act to protect American personnel .
& nbsp ;
The reports of Israeli airstrikes on Sunday in Syria come in the wake of the visit by US Central Command Air Force Commander Lt .- Gen . Gregory Guillot to Israel on Friday . The visit underpinned & ldquo ; strategic cooperation with American forces ,& rdquo ; IAF Commander Maj .- Gen . Amikam Norkin said .
& nbsp ;
The double blow to Iran from the US and Israel is not the first time Iran has been hit in Syria by both countries . Israel had carried out more than 1 , 000 airstrikes against Iranian targets in Syria , according to January 2019 reports . That number is likely closer to 1 , 500 airstrikes by now . The US carried out retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian - backed forces in Syria in December 2019 after an attack that killed a contractor at K - 1 base in Iraq .
& nbsp ;
In January , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged US intelligence support for Israeli airstrikes in Syria , according to Al - Monitor , a Washington - based news website . Can the US force Iran out of Syria , pondered Jared Szuba in a piece at Al - Monitor last December .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Are we ever going to get to a place where Iran does not have forces in Syria ?& rdquo ; Michael Mulroy , a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East , asked during a think - tank event on December 17 , the report noted . & ldquo ; I mean , people that are smarter on this than I have told me , no , that & rsquo ; s not going to happen .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;& ldquo ; Mulroy , a veteran CIA paramilitary officer who worked on Syria during his time at the Pentagon , suggested that minimizing Tehran & rsquo ; s influence in the Levant should remain a US goal ,& rdquo ; Szuba wrote . & ldquo ;& lsquo ; Maybe we should have a smarter take to it ,& rsquo ; he added .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
It is known that the US under the previous administration , including national security advisor John Bolton and secretary of state Mike Pompeo , sought to support Israel & rsquo ; s actions regarding Iran & rsquo ; s entrenchment in Syria .
& nbsp ;
Iran rapidly increased entrenchment since 2018 , and Iran & rsquo ; s forces have suffered accordingly . A strike in June 2018 hit a KH headquarters in Albukamal . Iraqi media at the time , reporting statements by the pro - Iranian Hashd al - Shaabi , blamed the US and Israel for the strikes .
& nbsp ;
IN AN interview in January , former US Syria envoy James Jeffrey showcased how Israel and the US are working together in Syria . In Foreign Affairs , the former American envoy on Syrian policy said : & ldquo ; US - supported Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in the country further limited the [ Syrian ] regime & rsquo ; s military options .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Jeffrey also told Szuba in an interview for Al - Monitor about the US support for Israeli airstrikes in Syria .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The US only began supporting that when I came on board ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; I went out there and we saw Prime Minister [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu and others , and they thought that they were not being supported enough by the US military , and not by intelligence . And there was a big battle within the US government , and we won the battle .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The argument [ against supporting Israel & rsquo ; s campaign ] was , again , this obsession with the counterterrorism mission . People didn & rsquo ; t want to screw with it , either by worrying about Turkey or diverting resources to allow the Israelis to muck around in Syria , as maybe that will lead to some blowback to our forces . It hasn & rsquo ; t .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Supporting Israel in Syria was a pillar of US policy on Syria .
& nbsp ;
The changeover in US administrations in January led to many questions about whether the US would continue to support Israel & rsquo ; s freedom of action in Syria and also whether the US would respond to Iranian attacks . Now we know that the support appears to be continuing and that both Israel and the US are willing to strike Iranian - backed forces or threats in Syria .
& nbsp ;
Linking Syria to Iran & rsquo ; s attacks elsewhere is a key aspect of the strikes over the last several days . That means Iran may be getting a message that if it does something in the Gulf of Oman , its militias could be targeted 2 , 000 kilometers away . The US appears to have said the same thing .
& nbsp ;
The idea that the militia units in Syria are responsible for guiding policies that target a ship in the Gulf of Oman or strike at a sensitive location in Erbil appears overwrought . It is the linkage and messaging and context of US support for Israeli actions in Syria that is important .
& nbsp ;
David Shor , who commentates on regional issues , noted on Twitter in a thread on the attacks : & ldquo ; Time will tell before we can ascertain precisely what was attacked tonight in Syria , and whether these targets can be differentiated at all from the hundreds of others targeted over the years in Syria .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
That is a key point , beyond the linkage , of what the strikes have hit and whether this matters to Iran .
& nbsp ;
Airstrikes have long been part of a larger Clausewitz - style , air - power diplomacy in the region , whereby an action in one place results in a reaction in another .
& nbsp ;
For instance , Iran was establishing a permanent military base in Syria at Al - Kiswah , a & ldquo ; Western intelligence source & rdquo ; told the BBC in November 2017 . Al - Kiswah has been struck several times since then , in May 2018 , June 2019 and in January 2021 .
& nbsp ;
Airstrikes in eastern Syria on Iranian - linked targets were carried out by Israel with intelligence provided by the US , a senior US intelligence official said this January .
& nbsp ;
There is now a long timeline from the Kiswah revelations in November 2017 , the warnings about Iranian entrenchment in 2017 and 2018 , the increasing entrenchment , the strike on the Hezbollah killer - drone team near the Golan Heights in August 2019 and then the revelations of increased US support for Israel & rsquo ; s actions in 2020 , as well as US airstrikes against Iranian elements in Syria in 2019 and now in 2021 .
& nbsp ;
The map of Israel - US involvement in Syria is growing and converging on Iran & rsquo ; s network of bases in the region , which stretches across its plethora of proxy forces from Iraq to Lebanon . This may pave the way for increased US - Israel cooperation in the region , or at least underpin a shared strategy .
