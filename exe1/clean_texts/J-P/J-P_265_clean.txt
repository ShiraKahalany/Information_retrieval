The sixth installment of the American Jewish Committee ' s Arabic - language video series " About the Jews " was released on Tuesday .
" About the Jews " is a YouTube video series released by AJC on their Arabic - language platforms and aims to challenge stereotypes and misconceptions within the Arab world about the State of Israel and the Jewish people .
The newest video in the series , " Is Israel Only for Jews ?," focuses on highlighting the coexistence of religious and ethnic groups in Israel , while challenging several notions regarding the daily life of an Arab - Israeli .
The video acknowledges inequalities and outstanding social challenges within Israel , as well as the democratic tools all citizens of Israel possess to address them .
" As the Arab world displays greater openness to Israel , it is important that perceptions of the Jewish state reflect its remarkable pluralism and diversity ," said AJC CEO David Harris .
" Israel is , at once , the homeland of the Jewish people and a thriving democracy that is home to more than 1 . 8 million Arab citizens , all of whom enjoy equal rights and freedoms ," added Harris .

AJC ' s video series , most watched in countries such as Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Morocco , Tunisia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates , also touched on other delicate subjects , such as the Jewish connection to Jerusalem , the Holocaust and the history of Muslim - Jewish relations .
" The barriers to peace between Israel and the Palestinians are political , not religious or ethnic ," said Harris . " We hope this new film will help promote Arab - Israeli peace by upending stereotypes about Israel and fostering greater understanding of the Jewish state throughout the Arab world ."
