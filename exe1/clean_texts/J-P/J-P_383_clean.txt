Israelis today have shiny biometric passports , but those from the nascent Jewish state in the 1950s were hand - written and issued well before computers existed ; they were also marked in French : & ldquo ; Valid to any country except Germany .& rdquo ; Israelis who wanted to visit Germany had to file a request . That condition was then deleted by an official drawing a line through the words . After the Reparations Agreement was signed between Israel and West Germany in 1952 , the passports became valid for travel to all countries . The history of travel documents in IsraelWhat about travel documents for those living in Mandatory Palestine before and after May 14 , 1948 ? Beginning almost a century ago , Jews and Arabs who lived in the land were able to acquire a Palestine passport issued by Britain . These were valid for two years only , and the text was written in Hebrew and French . The first Mandatory Palestine passport was issued in 1925 to Pinhas Rutenberg ( 1879 & ndash ; 1942 ), a Russian Jewish engineer who went on to build the mandate & rsquo ; s First Jordan Hydro - Electric Power House aka Rutenberg Power Station or Naharayim Power Station at the confluence of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers . This dammed hydroelectric power station operated from 1932 - 1948 in Jordan ( then , Imarat Sharq al - Urdun , the Emirate of Transjordan , a British protectorate from 1921 - 1946 ), supplying power to Mandatory Palestine . When the British Mandate of Palestine ended on May 15 , 1948 , the State of Israel began issuing travel documents with an initial validity of two years & ndash ; and printed and filled out in Hebrew and French & ndash ; until the Knesset passed the Israeli nationality law in 1952 .& nbsp ; Thereafter , the first Israeli passport issued was in the name of Golda Meir , who at the time worked for the Jewish Agency and was soon to become Israel & rsquo ; s ambassador to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ), aka the Soviet Union .ï€½
