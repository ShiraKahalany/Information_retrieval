Incoming prime minister Naftali Bennett will be sworn in on Sunday in the shadow of last month & rsquo ; s Gaza war , domestic Jewish - Arab unrest and amid the threat of renewed IDF - Hamas hostilities , particularly over Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
The sequence of events that are likely to unfold in the coming week , let alone the coming month , would be a test under fire for any prime minister , but will present a unique challenge for this particular government because of its unorthodox composition .
& nbsp ;
The new coalition headed by Bennett of the right - wing Yamina Party and incoming foreign minister Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid Party also includes left - wing parties and the Arab Islamist Ra & rsquo ; am Party .
& nbsp ;
It & rsquo ; s a coalition that has an unprecedented ideological range and many of the decisions that it makes are likely to involve principled compromises by one or more of its members .
& nbsp ;
The Israeli - Palestinian conflict is the most contentious and divisive arena for this coalition and issues relating to it are expected to be one of its weakest links .
& nbsp ;
It & rsquo ; s precisely here , on the Israeli - Palestinian front , the new coalition will be tested , both within its first week and its first month in these four ways .
& nbsp ;
1 . Evyatar outpost evacuation
& nbsp ;
Defense Minister Benny Gantz , who will retain his role in the new coalition , is poised to evacuate the West Bank outpost on Monday , less than 24 hours after the government is sworn in . The outpost was built last month in the aftermath of a Palestinian terror attack at the West Bank Tapuah junction , in which Yehuda Guetta , 19 , was killed . It was erected on a spot that settlers had first attempted to settle in 2013 in the aftermath of a Tapuah junction terror attack in which Evyatar Borovsky , 31 , was killed .
& nbsp ;
The reconstruction of the outpost named in Evyatar & rsquo ; s memory was largely ignored by the IDF . Within a month & rsquo ; s time , close to 50 families had moved onto the site .
& nbsp ;
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s plea to Gantz to allow the community to remain was ignored , so only direct intervention by Bennett can prevent its evacuation .
& nbsp ;
Should Bennett intervene , he would likely anger the left - wing flank of his coalition , as well as some of its centrist members , such as Gantz , who heads the Blue and White Party .
& nbsp ;
Such an evacuation , however , risks inflaming the West Bank and setting off a chain of violent events . Past outpost evacuations were often followed by violent retaliatory attacks by right - wing Jewish extremists against Palestinians . This would come at a time when Hamas is already attempting to inflame the West Bank .
& nbsp ;
2 . The Flag March
& nbsp ;
Police on Friday approved a parade route for a right - wing Flag March set for Tuesday , just one day after the anticipated West Bank outpost evacuation .
& nbsp ;
The annual event is typically associated with Jerusalem Day events that mark the celebration of the city & rsquo ; s unification in the aftermath of the Six Day War , in which Israel captured the eastern part of the city from Jordan and subsequently annexed it .
& nbsp ;
During Jerusalem Day last month , however , marchers were prohibited from following their traditional route through the Old City & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate and the Muslim Quarter , and were instead expected to head through the Jaffa Gate . Hamas fired seven rockets at Jerusalem during the march , thereby officially bringing it to a halt . This month , march organizers had sought to hold the march along its original route and in the end brokered a compromise with the police by which they would dance with flags by the Damascus Gate that opens into the Muslim Quarter .
& nbsp ;
The area in front of the gate has been one of the city flashpoint for Israeli - Palestinian violence . Police closure of the area briefly as a place of Palestinian gathering in April during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan was one of the initial sparks that led to May & rsquo ; s violent outbreak .
& nbsp ;
An Israeli flag dance by the Damascus Gate , which for the Right is an important symbol of sovereignty over the city , is similarly expected to ignite renewed Palestinian violence .
& nbsp ;
3 . Palestinian evictions in Jerusalem
& nbsp ;
There are four existing land issues in Jerusalem that could lead to the evictions of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in three east Jerusalem neighborhoods .
& nbsp ;
The one that captured both media attention and that of Hamas last month was the fate of some 28 families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood . The High Court of Justice has yet to decide whether to weigh in on the matter or to allow for the evictions to move forward . No date has been set for its decision .
& nbsp ;
But dates do exist for additional cases . The attorney - general is expected by the end of June to issue an opinion on a land case in Silwan & rsquo ; s Batan al - Hawa that could impact at least 700 Palestinians .
& nbsp ;
Another land case regarding al - Bustan in Silwan that could impact more than 1 , 000 Palestinians has been delayed until August . Some 13 families , however , could be in danger of losing their homes , irrespective of that ruling , because they fall under the dictates of the Kaminitz Law , which blocks them from seeking any additional legal recourse .
& nbsp ;
One such Palestinian family was already given a notice last week that he has 21 days to destroy half his home , otherwise the municipality would move to knock down that portion of his abode . It & rsquo ; s a demotion that could equally spark violence and the pending evictions that neighborhood have been under intentional scrutiny .
& nbsp ;
Lastly , the issue of pending evictions in the Walaja neighborhood of east Jerusalem is also due back in court on June 21 .
& nbsp ;
The Right has viewed each of the cases as land issues . The ones in al - Bustan and Walaja involve municipal plans for parks . The cases in Sheikh Jarrah and Batan al - Hawa involving property disputes between Palestinians and Jews .
& nbsp ;
But they are seen within the larger context of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and placed within the prism of the battle for sovereignty in Jerusalem , with the Left and the Palestinians believing that the eviction are an attempt by the city to seize control of Palestinian neighborhoods for Jewish projects and residents .
& nbsp ;
The neighborhood battles have sparked tension and violence , with the European Union and the US weighing in on behalf of the Palestinians . Hamas has also threatened violence as a result , and the issue of Sheikh Jarrah , in particular , was one of the sparks that led to May & rsquo ; s violence .
& nbsp ;
4 . Gaza
& nbsp ;
The IDF - Hamas 11 - day war ended on May 21 , but it & rsquo ; s unclear if the calm is a lull in the war or the end of this round of violence . Hamas has already renewed its threat of more rocket fire with regard to the Flag March and there exists a real chance it could make good on its threat .
& nbsp ;
Bennett and Lapid & rsquo ; s coalition could be in the position in its first week of deciding whether and how to retaliate should that happen . It would mark the first time that Israel would have a coalition with divergent views on how to handle Hamas rockets .
& nbsp ;
When Netanyahu became prime minister in 2009 , Hamas had been in charge of Gaza for less than two years , having ousted Fatah in a bloody coup in 2007 . The initial Gaza policy and the first Gaza war occurred under former prime minister Ehud Olmert & rsquo ; s watch .
& nbsp ;
The bulk of the Gaza policy , however & ndash ; including the 2012 and 2014 wars , as well as the border restrictions on goods & ndash ; has been set by Netanyahu . It was one of the areas of consensus within his government . The disagreements that existed centered around the question of whether Israel had been hash enough , rather than too lenient .
& nbsp ;
Bennett , who often criticized Netanyahu for not doing enough on Gaza , particularly with respect to the tunnel threat , will now have to decide how harsh a response he would authorize .
& nbsp ;
Even without violence , other questions must immediately be answered , particularly with regard to what type of goods can enter Gaza and what mechanism can be put in place to ensure that Hamas cannot divert materials for military use .
& nbsp ;
The terms of the calm between the IDF and Hamas that is now in place have yet to be set . Egypt is mediating indirect talks . It is still attempting to finalize those details while at the same time attempting to create a permanent ceasefire that could include the return of the remains of two IDF soldiers and the release of two Israeli citizens held by Hamas .
& nbsp ;
All these issues must now be dealt with by the Bennett government , with the possibility that the failure to find a satisfactory response could lead to renewed violence .
& nbsp ;
Egypt has also chosen this time to become more involved in Gaza , a move that could potentially lower the possibility of renewed Hamas rocket fire , but which may lead to tension points with Israel .
