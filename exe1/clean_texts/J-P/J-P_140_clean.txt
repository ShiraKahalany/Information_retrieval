& nbsp ; Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu oversaw some of the most virulent instances of diplomatic warfare against Israel since the & ldquo ; Zionism equals racism & rdquo ; battle at the United Nations in the last century .
& nbsp ;
The Israeli - Palestinian and the larger Israeli - Arab conflict have long fueled attempts to turn the Jewish state into a pariah nation .
& nbsp ;
The stakes were raised , however , because of the 2012 vote in the UN General Assembly that upgraded the status of the Palestinians to that of a non - member state . The Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s newfound status as a de facto UN state gave it a more expansive toolbox by which to pursue Israel and force it to execute a civilian and military withdrawal to the pre - 1967 lines .
& nbsp ;
At issue , however , was not just Israel & rsquo ; s hold on the West Bank , east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights . The initiatives also took aim at Israel & rsquo ; s Jewish identity , Jewish ties to its holy sites , and its right to self - defense .
& nbsp ;
Netanyahu offset some of that impact by linking some of the attacks with antisemitism and anti - Israel bias . He was more effective than past premiers in enlisting American support and in securing a circle of European , African and Asian allies . Issues of Palestinian incitement and support for terror also gained prominence during his tenure .
& nbsp ;
Here is a list of 12 victories and losses during his 12 - year prime ministerial reign that began in March 2009 and ended this week .
& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Losses
& nbsp ;
1 ) ICC opens war crimes probe against Israel
& nbsp ;
Israelis were not in danger of war crimes suits at the ICC when Netanyahu entered office .
& nbsp ;
The accession of the PA to the Rome Statute in 2015 changed that , and allowed the PA to request a war crimes probe into Israeli actions in the West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
The ICC ruled this year that it had jurisdiction to hear war crimes cases connected with that territory , and has opened a probe . While it is examining the possibility of war crimes cases against Israelis and Palestinians , it is presumed that the focus will be on potential Israeli war crimes .
& nbsp ;
Should the ICC conclude that a probe could be conducted , then individual Israelis , most likely its leaders , could find themselves facing war crimes charges .
& nbsp ;
2 ) UNHRC creates permanent probe against Israel
& nbsp ;
The UNHRC during Netanyahu & rsquo ; s tenure launched at least six fact - finding missions against Israel in an attempt to prove it had committed and continued to commit war crimes and serious human rights violations .
& nbsp ;
The most infamous was the initial probe headed by and named for South African jurist Richard Goldstone .
& nbsp ;
The Goldstone mission and two others explored potential Israeli war crimes during the three Gaza wars . One of the fact - finding missions probed alleged human rights abuses connected to West Bank settlements . The mission on the Hamas - led March of Return led to the creation of a database of IDF soldiers who potentially executed war crimes against the Palestinian participants .
& nbsp ;
This year the UNHRC created a permanent probe into potential Israeli human rights abuses , both within sovereign Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza , starting from April 13 , 2021 . Israel is the only country under permanent investigation for war crimes .
& nbsp ;
Separately it published a blacklist of companies doing business with Israeli entities located over the pre - 1967 lines . It & rsquo ; s the only country against whom such a blacklist has been published .
& nbsp ;
In 2018 it also began issuing an annual call for an arms embargo against Israel .
& nbsp ;
3 ) UNESCO registers Tomb of the Patriarchs to Palestine
& nbsp ;
UNESCO became the first UN body to recognize Palestine as a state , in 2011 . PA membership at UNESCO allowed the registration of three sites onto its World Heritage List : the Church of the Nativity , the Battir terraces and the Tomb of the Patriarchs . The registration focused primarily on the period when the Tomb was under Mamluk control in 1250 and through the Ottoman Empire period , rather than on the ancient and Biblical periods when it was in Jewish hands .
& nbsp ;
Israel withdrew from UNESCO in 2018 to protest its anti - Israel bias , after halting its annual payments to the organization in 2011 and losing its voting rights two years later .
& nbsp ;
4 ) EU product labeling
& nbsp ;
The European Union published guidelines in 2015 on how to place consumer labels on products from east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza , to clarify that they were not produced in Israel .
& nbsp ;
The guidelines were voluntary . Four years later , however , the EU Court of Justice ruled that all Israeli products produced over the pre - 1967 lines must be marked with such consumer labels .
& nbsp ;
5 ) UN launches apartheid investigation & nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination this year ceded to a request by the Palestinian Authority to investigate whether Israel had committed acts of apartheid . It would mark the first such UN investigation into such a charge based on the definition set out in the Rome Statute .
& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Victories
& nbsp ;
1 ) Abraham Accords put a damper on BDS
& nbsp ;
The Abraham Accords , which normalized ties between Israel and four Arab countries , took some of the wind out of the sails of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement . The willingness of Arab countries to do business with Israel made it more difficult for BDS to argue that other countries should boycott it .
& nbsp ;
2 ) ICC Mavi Marmara war crimes probe nixed
& nbsp ;
The International Criminal Court chief prosecutor rejected a request to probe Israel for war crimes relating to the IDF raid in 2010 against the Gaza - bound flotilla ship Mavi Marmara . The IDF forcibly boarded the ship as it attempted to break Israel & rsquo ; s maritime blockade of Gaza . During the raid , 10 Turkish activists aboard the ship were killed .
& nbsp ;
3 ) Only one UNSC anti - Israel resolution passed
& nbsp ;
The UN Security Council condemned Israel only once during Netanyahu & rsquo ; s tenure , which is a record in the institution & rsquo ; s treatment of Israel . It was the direct result of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s ability to secure opposition to such resolutions from former US presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump . The only exception was in 2016 , in the final weeks of the Obama administration , when the UNSC approved Resolution 2334 that condemned Israeli settlement activity and rejected Israeli sovereignty over any part of east Jerusalem , including the Western Wall .
& nbsp ;
4 ) Partial victory on the Jerusalem resolutions
& nbsp ;
The PA pushed for the UN to ignore Jewish ties to the Temple Mount by referencing that site and the Western Wall solely by their Muslim names of Al - Haram Al - Sharif and the Buraq Plaza . With the support of Arab states , it began to insert Muslim - only references in resolutions on Jerusalem passed by the UNESCO Executive Board at each of its bi - annual meetings . Those texts also disavowed Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
The Jerusalem resolutions were neutralized at UNESCO through a compromise in which the controversial elements of the text were placed in an annex . The PA has been more successful with a similar drive at the General Assembly , where it has an automatic majority of support .
& nbsp ;
5 ) Agenda Item 7 boycott
& nbsp ;
Netanyahu made no headway in swaying the UN Human Rights Council to rescind its mandate that the 47 - member body discusses alleged Israeli human rights abuses against the Palestinians at every one of its sessions under Agenda Item 7 .
& nbsp ;
But it successfully swayed European countries that the existence of such a mandate against only one country was an example of anti - Israel bias . As a result , most of the European countries boycott Agenda Item 7 sessions , which take place three times a year .
& nbsp ;
6 ) Spotlight on Pay - for - Slay
& nbsp ;
Netanyahu made significant inroads in persuading European and Western countries , particularly the United States , to take the Palestinian Authority to task for providing monthly stipends to Palestinian terrorists and their relatives . Israel has dubbed the practice & ldquo ; pay - for - slay .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The US took a strong stand on the issue , with Congress passing the Taylor Force Act that prohibits direct economic assistance to the PA until it halts the payments .
& nbsp ;
7 ) Condemnation of UNRWA incitement
& nbsp ;
Netanyahu also succeeded in generating awareness of UNRWA & rsquo ; s failure to ensure that its textbooks did not include inciting material against Jews and Israel .
& nbsp ;
The Biden administration has promised to link future funding to UNRWA to its adherence to a zero - tolerance policy for material that promotes hate and antisemitism against Jews and Israel .
& nbsp ;
The EU Parliament this year also condemned any use by UNRWA of such material .
