The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday that Israel was responsible for providing vaccines against the coronavirus to the Palestinians in the West Bank .
& nbsp ;
According to the PA , international laws and conventions require Israel to purchase and distribute vaccines to the Palestinian people who are living & ldquo ; under its military occupation .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
In addition , the authority said , it was Israel & rsquo ; s duty to give the vaccine to Palestinian security prisoners held in its prisons .
& nbsp ;
The PA announcement , made by the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , came amid controversy surrounding Israel & rsquo ; s responsibility for vaccinating the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
& nbsp ;
Palestinian officials have in the past two weeks made contradictory statements as to whether the PA had asked Israel for vaccines .
& nbsp ;
PA Health Ministry officials said in late December that they did not ask Israel to provide the Palestinians with the vaccine . The officials said they were seeking to obtain the vaccines from various companies , with the help of the World Health Organization .
& nbsp ;
Last week , however , a senior PA official told & nbsp ; The Jerusalem Post & nbsp ;& nbsp ; that the Palestinians were examining the possibility of asking Israel for vaccines .
& nbsp ;
But a PLO official said last weekend that they have not asked Israel for the vaccine .
& nbsp ;
The ministry denied a report by Kan , the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation , which said that Israel had secretly & nbsp ; sent dozens of doses & nbsp ; of vaccine to the Palestinians . The ministry said that Israeli & ldquo ; non - governmental & rdquo ; organizations had offered to send 20 doses of vaccines to the Palestinians as an & ldquo ; experiment .& rdquo ; The offer was turned down , the ministry added , without elaborating .
& nbsp ;
Meanwhile , the PA Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Israel , as an & ldquo ; occupying power ,& rdquo ; was obliged to provide vaccines to the Palestinians .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates affirms the duties of Israel , the occupying power , to provide vaccines against the coronavirus to the Palestinian people , at a time when it provides these vaccines to its own citizens ,& rdquo ; the statement read .
& nbsp ;
It warned that if Israel ignores its & ldquo ; duties ,& rdquo ; this would be regarded as & ldquo ; racial discrimination against the Palestinian people and a denial of their right to healthcare .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The ministry claimed that Israel was & ldquo ; trying to absolve itself of its duties as an occupying power , and fully blame the Palestinian government .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Noting that the PA was making an effort to secure vaccines from various sources , the ministry said that this does not & ldquo ; exempt Israel from its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people in providing them with vaccines & rdquo ; in accordance with international laws and conventions .
