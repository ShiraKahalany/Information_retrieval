There are a worrying number of videos about the Israel - Palestinian conflict that have been published on TikTok in recent days , often garnering hundreds of thousands if not millions of views , over 100 , 000 likes and more than 10 , 000 shares .


According to University of Haifa Prof . Gabriel Weimann , there is an alarming amount of fake news , and anti - Israel and anti - Jewish messaging being shared in these short films .


& ldquo ; Since no one controls , regulates or checks these videos , you can post whatever you want ,& rdquo ; he told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo ; There are a lot of lies .& rdquo ;


One video , for example , shows the tree that burned on top of the Temple Mount earlier this week . But in the film , the TikToker accuses Israel of trying to burn down al - Aqsa Mosque .& nbsp ;


The videos can be broken down into three categories : news , propaganda and political declarations .& nbsp ;


Some of the clips simply show the situation in Gaza from the Palestinian point of view , such as buildings collapsing or the population panicking as Israel carries out airstrikes .& nbsp ;


& ldquo ; We don & rsquo ; t really see a lot of this on Israeli TV and Western channels ,& rdquo ; Weimann said . & ldquo ; They get it out using TikTok and social media .& rdquo ;


Take a recent video by Shahed (@ shahed . kudsi ): & ldquo ; This world is sick ,& rdquo ; she says . & ldquo ; May Allah protect them .& rdquo ;


Then , she shows scenes in east Jerusalem of the protests and riots on the Temple Mount . Over the pictures it says , & ldquo ; In occupied East Jerusalem , Israeli occupation forces attacked Palestinians who had gathered to break their fast , throwing a stun grenade into a crowd of men , women and children .& rdquo ;

The video got 147 , 000 likes .


Another short clip selects a narrow view of an Israeli soldier dragging a Palestinian on the ground during a recent confrontation . The use of compelling music sensationalizes the episode . The video got 158 , 000 likes and close to 13 , 000 shares .

The propaganda reels can be divided into two categories : those produced by Palestinians in Arabic and those produced in English by Arabs or Muslims living in the United States or other English - speaking countries .


& ldquo ; Some of them are songs for Palestine , Sheikh Jarrah or Gaza & ndash ; made in the West and getting more than a million views ,& rdquo ; Weimann noted .


He said that because the videos are & ldquo ; made in TikTok - style , they are very attractive .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;


In a video titled & ldquo ; What is currently going on in Palestine ?& rdquo ; that had 51 , 500 shares , TikToker Solana (@ solanathagreenfairy ) explains : & ldquo ; One of the holiest sites in Islam , Al - Aqsa Mosque , is on fire . Israeli forces have shot Palestinians , thrown stun grenades all over the mosque and sprayed tear gas . There is a video currently circulating with hundreds of Israeli settlers singing and dancing and celebrating these horrendous attacks ,& rdquo ; she says .


& ldquo ; In addition to this , since last October , Israeli settlers have been stealing and moving into Palestinians & rsquo ; homes in Sheikh Jarrah ,& rdquo ; Solana says .& nbsp ;


& ldquo ; And since early this month , the situation has severely escalated . Far right - wing Zionists were marching through the streets chanting death to Arabs . As well as the military assaulting women and children and forcibly raiding homes .& rdquo ;


She calls on the public to & ldquo ; share informative resources to spread awareness and donate and sign petitions when you can .& rdquo ;

TikToker Kamelia (@ bnr . kamelia ), who appears to be French , jigs to a popular song while she spits on the Israeli flag and says she prefers s ** t over Israel .& nbsp ;

Her video got 313 , 000 likes .


The political declaration videos use TikTok to take viewers to other sites where they can learn more or take action . One of Kamelia & rsquo ; s videos , for example , informs watchers of how they can participate in local marches for Palestine .& nbsp ;


& ldquo ; These videos are not just videos ,& rdquo ; Weimann said . & ldquo ; They have political messages in the videos ; and in the comments , they link to other places to expand the exposure .& rdquo ;



TikTok has 1 . 2 billion active users . Half of them are in China , and half from around the world , & ndash ; many of them young people , including under the age of 13 , despite the community rules .



& ldquo ; Many young people get their information from social media ,& rdquo ; Weimann warned . & ldquo ; If they are exposed to the interpretation of the news through TikTok , that should make us worried .& rdquo ;


TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and has proved insensitive to public pressure to regulate the site . Weimann said he found a 1 , 100 % increase in antisemitic messaging on the platform between 2020 and 2021 .& nbsp ;


& ldquo ; Either TikTok is not willing to regulate against antisemitism or it has not been able to ,& rdquo ; he said .


What is Weimann & rsquo ; s best advice for countering fake videos ?


& ldquo ; Launch a countercampaign with counter - narratives ,& rdquo ; he said .
