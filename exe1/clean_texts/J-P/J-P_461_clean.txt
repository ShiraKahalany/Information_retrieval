With the arrival of Holocaust Remembrance Day , the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews ( IFCJ ) has reaffirmed its support for the Holocaust survivor community through its Dignity and Fellowship Program , which supports 17 , 000 of Israel & rsquo ; s poorest elderly over the age of 80 , including 8 , 500 Holocaust survivors , in 54 municipalities across the country . The program is committed to providing Holocaust survivors with food every week for the rest of their lives . Additionally , it enables survivors to engage in various social and practical services . Much - needed aid for Holocaust survivors & nbsp ; The support provided by the organization is vital , as a 2023 study that assessed the needs of the survivor community by the Foundation for the Welfare of Holocaust Victims found that 22 % of those who require financial support were forced to give up necessities due to lack of funds , including the use of electrical or medical equipment , medical tests , clothing , and other basic needs . 97 - year - old Merra Vinogradov , a Holocaust survivor who regularly receives food deliveries from the IFCJ , explained how the Fellowship had helped her , providing her with essential needs and more .& ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t need much and have always managed with little . The food deliveries from the Fellowship mean that I don & rsquo ; t have to worry about not having enough money for food . I can buy meat , fruit , and vegetables and don & rsquo ; t feel the lack of food like I did during my youth ,& rdquo ; she explained . Dedicated to their mission & nbsp ; According to the organization , & ldquo ; supporting and caring for Holocaust survivors is at the very heart of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews & rsquo ; 40 - year mission .& ldquo ; Our responsibility , and the responsibility of our hundreds of thousands of supporters around the world , is to care for this community , with dignity and respect , in every way possible while we still have the chance ,& rdquo ; explained Yael Eckstein , President of the IFCJ . Eckstein then elaborated on her firm commitment to continue the organization & rsquo ; s work for as long as it can .& ldquo ; We will make sure that Holocaust survivors are not forgotten and are provided with at least their basic needs until that tragic day when the last one leaves our world ,& rdquo ; Eckstein concluded . & ldquo ; These are people who suffered the worst and experienced unspeakable sacrifices and loss , and we owe it to them to spread the message of & lsquo ; Never Again & rsquo ; through action in a way that honors their lives .& rdquo ;
