The term & ldquo ; pogrom & rdquo ; is unfortunately back in our lexicon .& nbsp ;
Last week , Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described attacks by & ldquo ; a bloodthirsty Arab mob & rdquo ; in the mixed Jewish - Arab city of Lod as a & ldquo ; pogrom .& rdquo ; A Jewish vigilante in Lod told The Washington Post that he was defending its Jewish residents & ldquo ; from a pogrom .& rdquo ;
On the other side , when a video captured Jewish rioters beating what they took to be an Arab man in Bat Yam , a Pakistani writer tweeted , & ldquo ; This is what a pogrom looks like .& rdquo ;
So what exactly is a pogrom ? And are Jews the inevitable , exclusive victims ?
It & rsquo ; s been over a century since the Russian word & ldquo ; pogrom & rdquo ; entered the English language , but the civil unrest in Israel is unfortunately bringing the term back into current usage .
The New York Times , using the Yiddish plural & ldquo ; pogromen ,& rdquo ;& nbsp ; first cited the term in 1882 to describe the wave of anti - Jewish violence that followed the assassination of Czar Alexander II , and provided a helpful inline definition : & ldquo ; riots against the Jews .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
The Slavic root of the term , derived from the evocative word & ldquo ; to thunder ,& rdquo ; adds tone but otherwise gives little indication of its meaning . Pogrom was one of many words , including & ldquo ; riot ,& rdquo ; & ldquo ; upheaval & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; disorderly conduct ,& rdquo ; used to describe the horrific attacks that plagued Jewish villages in the Russian Empire from 1881 to 1884 as transient Russian workers rode the rails from shtetl to shtetl , stopping at every station to beat , rape and occasionally murder .& nbsp ;
In the wake of the violence , some 1 . 75 million Eastern European Jews migrated to the United States , the numbers tapering off only in the 1920s when restrictive immigration quotas were imposed . The term pogrom migrated with them , from Russian to Yiddish to English .
In the late 19th century , many Jewish activists believed that Alexander III , the new czar , had given his blessing to the pogroms by directing police to turn a blind eye to the violence . This view was famously captured in Sholom Aleichem & rsquo ; s writings and in the musical & ldquo ; Fiddler on the Roof ,& rdquo ; based on his stories , when the local police chief lets Tevye in on the secret plans for an upcoming pogrom .& nbsp ;
Toward the end of the 20th century , archival research led historians to dismiss that interpretation of the pogroms . & nbsp ; The 1881 - 1884 pogroms were not organized by the bureaucratically inept Russian government , which viewed the uncontrollable violence as a threat to the stability of the regime as a whole .& nbsp ;
By contrast , the far more brutal pogroms of the 20th century , including the notorious Kishinev pogrom of 1903 and the bloody pogroms that engulfed Ukraine during the chaos that followed World War I , showed much clearer signs of coordination by authorities at various levels . The last czar , Nicholas II , tacitly encouraged the violence by openly supporting the violent Black Hundreds organization and even underwriting the publication of the antisemitic work & ldquo ; The Protocols of the Elders of Zion .& rdquo ;
The definition of the word pogrom thus has come to include three essential elements : a violent mob , Jewish victimhood and at least the appearance of some level of central planning or incitement , although the attacks themselves seem more spontaneous .& nbsp ;
Although the word pogrom first emerged in the late 19th century , it was later applied anachronistically to incidents in the distant past . Social upheavals directed against Jews are virtually as old as Jewish history itself , with the street violence of Alexandria , Egypt , in the year 38 C . E . considered the earliest example .& nbsp ;
Throughout the medieval period , a combination of religious fervor and bloodlust motivated ordinary citizens to rise up and attack Jews in hundreds of crusades , blood libels and false charges of host desecration , often with the tacit or explicit approval of ruling authorities .& nbsp ;
The term pogrom is rarely used to describe the events of the Holocaust , on quantitative and qualitative grounds : The Nazis murdered millions in a hierarchical , organized and bureaucratic manner unlike the erratic and spontaneous attacks by pogromists . Nevertheless , certain specific incidents from World War II might qualify , such as the notorious Petliura Days of Lviv or the massacres of the Jews of Jedwabne . Kristallnacht , the & ldquo ; night of broken glass & rdquo ; that presaged the genocide , is often described as a pogrom .
The word may be borrowed for other purposes & mdash ; the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary relates a few citations & mdash ; but they often sound wrong , like dark examples of cultural appropriation . Non - Jewish populations often suffered very similar attacks & mdash ; Mennonites were horribly brutalized by anarchist bands in Ukraine , for example , and their woes compounded by deeply held pacifist beliefs that prevented self - defense & mdash ; but pogrom is deeply rooted in Jewish history and narrative , no less than & ldquo ; intifada & rdquo ; is rooted in the Palestinian narrative .
Two of the classic elements of the historical pogrom are sadly present in the streets of some Israeli cities , namely mob violence and Jewish victims . The appearance of central planning , however , is hard to identify , and the term doesn & rsquo ; t account for the fact that the government and law enforcement are predisposed to defend Israel & rsquo ; s Jewish citizens . Historically , pogroms are synonymous with Jewish powerlessness . Is it possible to speak of a pogrom when the state authorities responsible for maintaining public order are Jewish ?& nbsp ;
As for the use of the term pogrom by the pro - Palestinian side : Is that a fair label , with its ironic connotation that the former victims of pogroms have become its perpetrators ? Or a foul appropriation meant to erase Jewish history and & ldquo ; flip the script & rdquo ;?& nbsp ;
The debate is similar to the ones over how to describe urban unrest in this country : Are they & ldquo ; race riots & rdquo ;? & ldquo ; Rebellions & rdquo ;? & ldquo ; Police riots & rdquo ;? & ldquo ; Uprisings & rdquo ;?& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
Perhaps none of this discussion is helpful from a practical standpoint . When neighbors rise up and physically assault each other , especially after decades of peaceful coexistence , perhaps it doesn & rsquo ; t really matter what term we use to describe the violence .
But the language we use shapes our response to a crisis & mdash ; words matter . From the standpoint of history , naming the violence a pogrom , a riot or an intifada will have implications for how the State of Israel chooses to contain the threat .
