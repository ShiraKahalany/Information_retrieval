One of the protesters who was arrested reportedly stabbed an 18 - year - old during clashes that broke out between Jews and Bedouin . The injured teen was evacuated to Soroka Medical Center in the city in moderate - to - serious condition .
& nbsp ;
One of the policemen who was present at the scene and noticed the incident fired into the air . 

Police said the suspect fled and attempted to take shelter in the nearby medical center , but was thwarted with the help of the hospital @@@ s security guards and subsequently arrested .

Another man in his 40s was lightly injured from tear gas at the protest and was also evacuated to Soroka .


A Jewish student at Ben - Gurion University of the Negev and activist in the Kumi Israel protest movement said she was rescued by Border Police officers from being & quot ; lynched & quot ; by right - wing protesters after arriving at the scene to document the protests , the movement said in a statement .
& nbsp ;
In her video , dozens of right - wing protesters can be seen gathered around the activist , calling her a & quot ; whore for Arabs & quot ; and threatening to harm her as Border Police forces who were at the scene protected her and escorted her from the scene back to her car .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
The activist said & quot ; I felt a real danger to my life . If I had not been surrounded by five Border policemen , I would not have left that protest alive ; there was a guy who had already begun swinging his hand in my direction .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
Further video released by the activist revealed that a man had indeed tried to swing his fist at her before police moved him away and began escorting her to her car .
& nbsp ;
A witness at the scene told Kumi Israel that & quot ; Hundreds of demonstrators gathered around her and blocked her on both sides of the road , cursing , shouting and threatening her , until a Border Police officer rescued her .& quot ;

Israeli Police reported that a 42 - year - old man was stabbed at the Temple Mount compound on Tuesday evening and that the Red Crescent has evacuated him to a hospital , where his death was determined shortly thereafter .
& nbsp ;
Police added that officers who arrived at the scene have likely located the weapon used in the assault and that & quot ; actions are being taken to locate those involved in the incident .& quot ;
