Palestinians on Thursday expressed anger over reports that British Prime Minister Liz Truss was studying relocating her country & rsquo ; s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . Some Palestinians described the move as & ldquo ; a new Balfour Declaration & rdquo ; and said it proves Britain & rsquo ; s bias in favor of Israel . A Palestinian Authority official said the Palestinian leadership has not received an official statement from the British government regarding the relocation of the embassy . The official warned that such & ldquo ; dangerous & rdquo ; moves would have a negative impact on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict . Moving the British embassy to JerusalemThe official pointed out that the reports about moving the British Embassy to Jerusalem surfaced shortly after a meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Truss , who are both in New York to attend the annual United Nations General Assembly session .& ldquo ; If Britain wants to play any role in the region , it must avoid taking any decision that only causes harm and aggravates tensions ,& rdquo ; the official told The Jerusalem Post . Sabri Saidam , a former PA cabinet minister and senior member of the ruling Fatah faction headed by Abbas , also rejected any decision to move the British Embassy to Jerusalem . Referring to the transfer of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem just over years ago , Saidam told the PA & rsquo ; s Voice of Palestine radio station , & ldquo ; Britain is not America , and it has historical obligations toward the Palestinian people . The catastrophes of the Palestinian people were based on the Balfour Declaration .& rdquo ; The Fatah official said that instead of moving the embassy to Jerusalem , the British government should recognize a sovereign Palestinian state & ldquo ; as a simple step to correct is historical mistake .& rdquo ; Mustafa Barghouti , secretary - general of the Palestinian National Initiative Party , said the British prime minister belongs to the & ldquo ; pro - Zionist & rdquo ; conservatives and is known for flip - flopping on her stances .& ldquo ; The announcement by the British Prime Minister Liz Terrace about her intention to move her country & rsquo ; s embassy to Jerusalem , is a flagrant bias towards the occupation .& rdquo ; Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif QanouBarghouti claimed that Truss and her friends were trying to win the support of the Jewish community in Britain .& ldquo ; I wasn & rsquo ; t surprised because the positions of this British government are against the interests of the Palestinian people ,& rdquo ; Barghouti , a former PA presidential candidate , said in an interview with a local Palestinian radio station . & ldquo ; But I don & rsquo ; t think they will succeed in moving the embassy because of the fierce opposition by the friends of the Palestinians in Britain .& rdquo ; Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad condemned the reports about the intention to relocate the British Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .& ldquo ; The announcement by the British Prime Minister Liz Truss about her intention to move her country & rsquo ; s embassy to Jerusalem is a flagrant bias toward the occupation ,& rdquo ; said Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Qanou . He warned that the move would not give Israel any legitimacy & ldquo ; over one inch of our land .& rdquo ; Another Hamas official , Hazem Qassem , warned that moving the British Embassy would be considered as a new crime by Britain against the Palestinian people . Islamic Jihad senior official Mohammed Shalah accused Britain of continuing to display & ldquo ; arrogance & rdquo ; against the Palestinians .& ldquo ; We are not surprised by what Britain is doing in light of the ongoing Arab and Islamic silence ,& rdquo ; said Shalah . & ldquo ; We blame the Arab and Islamic countries that are supposed to support Jerusalem .& rdquo ; Another PIJ official , Tareq Salmi , warned that the alleged British plan would spark the anger of the Arabs and Muslims . He denounced the reported plan as a & ldquo ; hideous colonial aggression & rdquo ; against the Palestinians , adding , & ldquo ; Britain is directly responsible for the tragedy of the Palestinian people .& rdquo ;
