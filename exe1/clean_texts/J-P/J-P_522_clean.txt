When asked by CBS how many hostages are still alive , Ghazi Hamad , stated " I don ' t know . The number is not so important ." The interview came a day before the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended , as the terrorist group refused to release the hostages it had committed to release and instead began launching rockets toward southern Israel early Friday morning . Hamad says Hamas kidnapped baby , brother to ' pressure Israel ' Hamad additionally told CBS that Hamas had kidnapped 10 - month - old Kfir Bibas and his four - year - old brother Ariel in order to force them to " impose pressure on their government , to tell them that you pushed us to hell ." When asked how a 10 - month - old baby and four - year - old boy could take action to pressure the Israeli government , Hamad simply repeated that " they have to exert pressure on Israel , their government , in order to tell them that you are going in the wrong way ." The Hamas leader said that the Bibas family " paid the price because of the occupation ." Hamas has claimed in recent days that Kfir , Ariel , and their mother Shiri were killed after being kidnapped on October 7 .
