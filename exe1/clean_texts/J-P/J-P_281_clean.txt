Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) leaders have called for stepping up attacks against Israel , especially in the West Bank . The call was made during a meeting in Beirut between Saleh al - Arouri , deputy chairman of the Hamas Politburo , and PIJ Secretary - General Ziyad al - Nakhaleh . The meeting took place on Saturday night and was attended by several representatives of the two Iranian - backed Islamist groups . It took place amid mounting violence in the West Bank and a Palestinian Authority security crackdown on members of the two groups . It also came ahead of the formation of a new Israeli governing coalition headed by Prime Minister - designate Benjamin Netanyahu .& ldquo ; The two sides affirmed the joint cooperation in strengthening and activating the resistance of our people in all of Palestine in the face of the Israeli occupation and criminality ,& rdquo ; Hamas said in a statement after the meeting . & ldquo ; They also emphasized the importance of rallying around the resistance in all its forms .& rdquo ; Resistance and confrontation & nbsp ; Hamas and PIJ use the term & ldquo ; resistance & rdquo ; to refer to the use of violence and armed attacks against Israel . Hamas said the two sides stressed the importance of & ldquo ; confronting Zionist schemes that aim to undermine the resistance and liquidate the Palestinian cause .& rdquo ; Meanwhile , Abu Obeida , spokesman for Izzadin al - Qassam , the so - called military wing of Hamas , on Sunday hinted that his group was planning to kidnap IDF soldiers .& ldquo ; The decision to increase the number of soldiers held by the Izzadin al - Qassam Brigades remains effective and is being carried out ,& rdquo ; he said in an interview with a Hamas - affiliated website to mark the 35tth anniversary of the founding of Hamas . He was referring to the remains of IDF soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul , who were killed during the 2014 Israel - Hamas war .& ldquo ; The [ Israeli ] enemy will regret its intransigence regarding a new prisoner - exchange deal ,& rdquo ; he said , regarding Israel & rsquo ; s alleged refusal to release thousands of Palestinian security prisoners held in Israeli jails in return for the bodies of the soldiers . Two Israeli civilians who reportedly entered the Gaza Strip on their own , Hisham al - Sayed and Avera Mengistu , are also being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip . Last week , Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar said his group would give Israel & ldquo ; a limited time to complete the [ prisoner - exchange ] deal .& rdquo ; Otherwise , Hamas & ldquo ; will close the file of the four enemy prisoners forever and find another way to liberate our prisoners ,& rdquo ; he said in a speech to mark the Hamas anniversary . Abu Obeidah said in the interview that the Izzadin al - Qassam Brigades & ldquo ; forms the nucleus of the Palestinian Liberation Army .& rdquo ; The rising tensions and violence in the West Bank was the most significant action in the past 15 years and would have & ldquo ; strategic consequences on the future of the Zionist entity ,& rdquo ; he said . Addressing the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem , Abu Obeidah urged them to & ldquo ; continue escalating the resistance because we are facing an existential battle .& rdquo ; In a related development , a committee representing several Palestinian factions in the West Bank on Sunday called on Palestinians to & ldquo ; target the settlements with all available means and tools & rdquo ; until the settlers no longer feel safe and leave the Palestinian territories .& nbsp ;
