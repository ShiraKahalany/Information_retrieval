As tensions escalated along the Gaza border with retaliatory airstrikes in response to a rocket fired on Monday evening , all 13 - year - old Libi Kohn of Ein Hashlosha wanted was for there to be calm , so her kibbutz youth group could hold its planned gathering in the evening .& ldquo ; I just mostly hope that this won & rsquo ; t develop into anything , and we can go on with our activity and I can meet with my friends ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; We asked our counselor whether it would be canceled , and he said he didn & rsquo ; t know yet . So we are waiting . I want the Passover vacation to be like it should be where I can enjoy it with friends .& rdquo ; The rocket fired from Gaza followed tensions in Jerusalem , as dozens of Palestinian rioters were injured and hundreds arrested following violent clashes with police on the Temple Mount . The sound of sirens has been so much a part of Kohn & rsquo ; s life that she didn & rsquo ; t know if she could really use the word & ldquo ; fear & rdquo ; to describe how she felt when she heard the red alert phone application beep , when a rocket was launched at her kibbutz just as she was sitting down to dinner with her family at her grandparents & rsquo ; home at around 8 : 30 p . m .& ldquo ; We heard the red alert for Kissufim , and at first didn & rsquo ; t understand what was happening ,& rdquo ; said Kohn . & ldquo ; Then we heard a loud boom and ran to the bomb shelter in the house .& rdquo ; The whole family had gathered for dinner , 16 people altogether . & ldquo ; We let my grandmother go in first so she could sit down , and then we the grandchildren went in .& rdquo ; The rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile - defense system . There were no reports of injuries . After the all - clear , they returned to the dinner table . At night they closed the metal window on the bomb shelter , which is also Libi & rsquo ; s bedroom , and made sure there was a clear path to the room in case the family needed to reach it in the middle of the night .& ldquo ; I want the government to create a situation where we don & rsquo ; t have to pay for the situation every Passover ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; We want the government to make us feel safe so we don & rsquo ; t have to pack a suitcase all the time and run . I don & rsquo ; t know how they should do that , but the nation voted for them and it is time that they do that .& rdquo ; There are no magical solutions to the situation , said Libi & rsquo ; s mother , Meirav , 49 , who was born in Ein Hashlosha .& ldquo ; You never know when or where it will come , but we understand that with everything that is happening in Jerusalem , we will end up paying the price ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; When the security situation heats up , it will end up reaching Gaza .& rdquo ; FOR THE most part , the Kohns enjoy a quality of life that makes up for the occasional missiles they have to contend with . & ldquo ; I am sure this is where I want my kids to grow up , even if sometimes we have these & rdquo ; attacks , said Meirav . But the government should reach a comprehensive solution once and for all , she said , even if that means an initial military operation to get both sides to the negotiating table . Almost 4 , 400 rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza in May & rsquo ; s 11 - day war , Operation Guardians of the Wall , in which 256 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed . In 2014 , Operation Protective Edge lasted six weeks and some 2 , 100 Palestinians were killed , including 1 , 462 civilians . Sixty - six Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli citizens were also killed . Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 left 167 Palestinians , including 87 civilians , and two Israeli soldiers and four civilians dead , according to B & rsquo ; Tselem .& ldquo ; It is obviously a very challenging situation for all the governments , also for the last government ,& rdquo ; Meirav said . & ldquo ; Before we reach a solution we need a serious military operation , but at the same time , if we keep doing the same thing all the time , nothing will change . I do expect the government to be ready after the next war for the day after , and to come with clear goals and to sit and talk and come to an agreement for the last time & ndash ; not to just come , reach a ceasefire agreement , and then go home .& rdquo ; Sirens were also activated on Sunday afternoon in Nahal Oz . The IDF later said they were false alarms . However , 67 - year - old Adele Raemer , who has lived on Kibbutz Nirim since 1975 , said Israeli residents living along the Gaza border know there is no such thing as a false alarm .& ldquo ; A false alarm means something was shot at us from Gaza and didn & rsquo ; t reach the border ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; So two days ago after the & lsquo ; false alarm ,& rsquo ; we knew something could happen . We have been getting rockets since 2006 . This is not something anybody gets used to but is something you learn to live with . Everyone is aware and ready . We know how to sense an escalation .& rdquo ; With Ramadan coinciding with Passover , and with Israeli Independence Day and Yom Hazikaron coming up , it can become a & ldquo ; prime time for terror ,& rdquo ; she said . However , Raemer noted , most Gaza residents do not want an escalation now with an increase of work permits being issued by Israel and Egypt , sending experts to help them rebuild the infrastructure destroyed in last year & rsquo ; s war .& ldquo ; That is something they don & rsquo ; t want to lose ,& rdquo ; she said . And while Islamic Jihad has been held responsible for the latest rocket attack , it is Hamas that controls Gaza and needs to be accountable .& ldquo ; We are the strong ones here , and I would really prefer that we don & rsquo ; t do things that can be seen as inflammatory ,& rdquo ; Raemer said . & ldquo ; I understand we want to say this is our land , and people have the right of freedom of expression , but we have to take responsibility for our actions .& rdquo ; Raemer mentioned the planned flag march by the Im Tirzu NGO .& ldquo ; Going out on a march just to beat our chests can have an effect on the rest of our country ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; I hope people will keep their heads on straight and not do something that will be inflammatory .& rdquo ;
