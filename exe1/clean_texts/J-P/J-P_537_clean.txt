The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Quds Force head Esmail Ghaani praised Hamas on Thursday . 

Iran has been watching closely the Hamas tactics against Israel and is proud that the Hamas terrorists it supports are achieving what it claims is a victory against Israel . This includes claims Hamas has targeted more Israeli air bases and that the & ldquo ; Zionist regime & rdquo ; is facing defeat , according to the IRGC .
& nbsp ;
In a letter to Hamas & rsquo ; s military commander Mohammed Deif , the commander of the IRGC & rsquo ; s Quds Force called him a & ldquo ; living martyr & rdquo ; and wrote that he was confident of the victory of the & ldquo ; resistance & rdquo ; in Gaza , according to Fars News . A reputed copy of the letter was also posted online . & ldquo ; O & rsquo ; you living martyr who has spent his life in the front row of Jihad and is confident of victory ; I address you as a brave and devoted commander and I say to all the commanders and Mujahedin of the resistance groups on my behalf and on behalf of the leadership of the Islamic Republic and I promise that you will be victorious and you were faithful to your promise and to the enemy ,& rdquo ; the posted version reads .
& nbsp ;
In the letter he claimed that Israel was tasting & ldquo ; fear , defeat and humiliation .& rdquo ; He also wrote greetings to the people of Gaza and to Arabs living in Israel , as well as Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank . & ldquo ; The Palestinian people have proved to the whole world that they are alive and that over the years they will not be able to forget their rights , as the delusional people thought .& rdquo ; He said that now Iran and its allies are in the midst of a & ldquo ; great operation & rdquo ; called & ldquo ; Saif al - Quds & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; Sword of Jerusalem ,& rdquo ; which has begun and entered a new phase of battle against Israel . The letter says that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei & ldquo ; has emphasized that the countdown to the destruction of the enemy has begun .& rdquo ; 

This is in line with statements made in Iran over the past two weeks . It gives evidence of Iran & rsquo ; s direct planning and role in Hamas attacks on Israel . Iran and Turkey have long backed Hamas . Turkish media has encouraged a pan - Islamic alliance of Iran , Turkey , Qatar , Pakistan and Malaysia to fight Israel .
& nbsp ;
Meanwhile Iran says Hamas has struck at Israeli airports , a key part of the Iranian plan apparently . In Iran IRGC commander Hossein Salami who had predicted Israel could be defeated with one large tactical operation gave a speech where he also praised the & ldquo ; strong resistance put & rdquo ; up by the Palestinians in the face of Israel . & ldquo ; More than two - thirds of Zionist cities were attacked by Palestinian rockets from Gaza , leaving no safe haven for them . All of the Israeli regime & rsquo ; s missile defense systems have failed against thousands of Palestinian missiles .& rdquo ; Iran thinks the Hamas & ldquo ; rocket intifada & rdquo ; has weakened Israel . Israel faces a major crisis , Iran says .
