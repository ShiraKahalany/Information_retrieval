The outbreak of the Israel - Hamas war and the horrors of October 7 sent Israel Elwyn & rsquo ; s early intervention centers into chaos , said the director of Elwyn & rsquo ; s Haifa and Northern Israel Branch , Keren Strul .& ldquo ; Like the rest of the country , we were caught unaware ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; There were hardly any [ early intervention ] frameworks in which the war did not have a personal impact on each of the families .& rdquo ; Proving services to thousands of people in Israel with disabilitiesElwyn Israel provides services to over 5 , 400 people in Israel with disabilities , and its early intervention centers provide rehabilitation and treatment to children from six months to three years old . The centers treat kids with developmental delays and autism , and research shows that this early intervention can have a significant impact on their progression , the organization explained . Elwyn & rsquo ; s goal , and one of the goals of the intervention centers , is to provide people with tools to promote their independence and involvement in the community , and they work based on the belief that everyone deserves to be included in society . The children treated at these centers go through a daily schedule that is very similar to what children their age experience in other frameworks , but in addition to their preschool day , they receive a wide variety of treatment , including occupational , speech , and physical therapy . From the outbreak of the war , it took around two weeks until Elwyn was able to overcome the chaos of the beginning and to get organized , said Strul .& ldquo ; My organization knows how to quickly get on board and offer services in an emergency , in the war , as it did in the corona pandemic ,& rdquo ; she explained . & ldquo ; We were one of the first organizations to provide services & rdquo ; after the war & rsquo ; s outbreak , she said . Strul noted how important her organization & rsquo ; s ability to work independently was , because it meant that Elwyn did not have to & ldquo ; wait for the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry or the Home Front Command , who first needed to handle things that were bigger than intervention centers .& rdquo ; Her work was very emotional , helping parents handling impossible situations , as she coped with the war herself , Strul shared .& ldquo ; An experience that touched me personally was the story of one of the mothers from the North ,& rdquo ; Strul shared . The mother & ldquo ; was evacuated and had just received a diagnosis that her child is autistic . Before she came to us , she didn & rsquo ; t know what to do ,& rdquo ; Strul said , explaining that the mother was forced to leave her home right after receiving her child & rsquo ; s diagnosis and had no idea what framework was appropriate for , or accessible to , her child during the war . To make matters more complicated , this mother & rsquo ; s husband was called to reserve duty and was unreachable in Gaza . She then she found out she was pregnant with her second child .& ldquo ; You have to understand that the evacuees have a very difficult experience because they have been uprooted from their homes ,& rdquo ; said Strul , explaining that things are especially hard when you & ldquo ; uproot a child with a disability from their home .& rdquo ; Strul shared that she marveled at the difficulty of the situation , asking herself how she could help someone handling so much chaos .& ldquo ; She [ the mother ] really fell apart ,& rdquo ; described Strul . Along with her team , Strul helped the mother to find an appropriate framework , and providing this help gave Strul the chance to take action , which , in turn , helped her handle her own experience . It & ldquo ; made me sharper and kept me from sinking in the sadness and terrible grief we are all dealing with ,& rdquo ; she explained . Personally helping this woman & ldquo ; took me to a place of & lsquo ; okay , I have a job to do , and I need to lead the team and help the families , and have some routine ,& rsquo ;& rdquo ; she said , adding that this story made her stronger . ANOTHER ELEMENT that made things emotionally difficult for many employees and intervention center families was the mixed Arab - Jewish nature of many of Elwyn & rsquo ; s teams , said Strul . This proximity at work & ldquo ; brought up the conflict that exists in the country ,& rdquo ; she said . It was hard to avoid sensitive topics , at a time when tensions and emotions were so high . There were & ldquo ; parents whose children were in preschools with Arab staff ,& rdquo ; which brought up fears for some of them , described Strul , adding that & ldquo ; this also impacted Arab employees who encountered Jewish parents who were uncomfortable with them .& rdquo ; Strul handled these feelings with open communication . & ldquo ; You have to give these feelings space ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; If you pretend these feelings don & rsquo ; t exist , they will come out in the end . So , first of all , we decided that we were going to give them space and talk about them on a local level .& ldquo ; If we saw that there were problems or conflicts , feelings that sometimes aren & rsquo ; t apparent on the surface but are under the surface , we addressed them ,& rdquo ; she said . IN ADDITION to the emotional turmoil of helping the families from their centers , Elwyn & rsquo ; s staff had to contend with numerous logistical hurdles . Some of the centers did not have appropriate shelters and needed to be totally relocated to spaces with adequate protection . Some centers were too close to conflict zones , and needed to be totally evacuated . The organization offered a variety of solutions , depending on the stage of the war and the unique needs it presented .& ldquo ; We offered services from afar , using videos . An occupational therapist would show parents how to help with their child & rsquo ; s treatment at home ,& rdquo ; said Strul , who added that the organization recruited numerous volunteers to help provide these services . The organization also prepped the center & rsquo ; s shelters and drilled taking the children into the shelter in the appropriate time frame . Elwyn staff created special activities for the children to do while they were in shelters , to try to make the time pass more calmly . Caring for these families in the chaos of the war was an incredible challenge , but no less of a challenge was the job of caring for the early intervention center staff , Strul explained .& ldquo ; The son of one of our workers was murdered at the [ Super ] nova music festival ,& rdquo ; Strul recounted . & ldquo ; It was a shock , encountering that on a personal level , when one of your workers loses her 21 - year - old son . She was totally broken ,& rdquo ; said Strul , who added that handling this loss of someone who is a daily part of her life caused her to break down as well .& ldquo ; We accompanied her for the whole shiva [ mourning period ] and we were with her and came to visit her ,& rdquo ; Strul said , adding that they also provided space for the staff to process the loss together . Many of Strul & rsquo ; s staff were also evacuated from their homes in the North . & ldquo ; There was a lot of thought put into what happens with those workers , how can we help them so they will come back to a sort of schedule ,& rdquo ; Strul explained .& ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think there was a single worker who did not get the care they needed ,& rdquo ; she said . Looking forward , Strul feels prepared to handle whatever the continuation of the war , or possible escalation in the north , might throw their way . There is a feeling that the war is present . & ldquo ; There could be a siren today ,& rdquo ; said Strul , & ldquo ; but it doesn & rsquo ; t occupy us daily .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; What is important is that , in an emergency , the staff knows what to do with each child , where to take them , where the safe area is for each structure , who the Home Front Command contact is , what is in the shelter , what equipment ,& rdquo ; she explained . Unexpected events will always be present , but Strul isn & rsquo ; t worried . When asked why , her answer is simple : & ldquo ; Because we are prepared for it .& rdquo ;
