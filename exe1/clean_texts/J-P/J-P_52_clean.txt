The current campaign between Israel and Hamas is the fiercest one since the 2014 war . It should end because of several reasons .
& nbsp ;
Israel & rsquo ; s Iron Dome is successful in intercepting rockets , but as the campaign continues , the chances that one or several rockets will cause heavy Israeli casualties rapidly increases . A significant blow , harming dozens of Israelis , might push Israel to launch a large - scale ground offensive , deep inside the Gaza Strip . Such an attack might seek to defeat Hamas once and for all , but toppling its rule would likely force Israel into the position of conquering the Strip altogether , an outcome Israel does not ultimately desire .
& nbsp ;
The Gaza Strip is a small area ( 365 square kilometers ), and it has been highly monitored by Israel , making it easier for the IDF to gather vital information about Hamas and other groups there . The IDF also has been training to confront Hamas . Nevertheless , in retaking the Gaza Strip , hundreds of Israeli troops will be killed or injured , fighting their foe above and underground .
& nbsp ;
Hamas dug long tunnels in the Gaza Strip , preparing itself for war , including as part of an IDF territorial seizure . The fight would therefore not be over after the IDF captured the entire Gaza Strip . The IDF would have to destroy the existing military infrastructure . Palestinian combatants , not only from Hamas , would aspire to harm Israelis , including taking them as prisoners . Israelis in the Gaza Strip would inevitably be targets for ambushes , IEDs , etc .
& nbsp ;
As in prior similar campaigns , Israel has relied on firepower , mostly through aircraft , to make significant achievements . However , these accomplishments fall short of the chance for complete victory . Since Israel will not retake the Gaza Strip , Hamas will keep its base , recover and produce additional and more sophisticated rockets and missiles with longer range , accuracy etc . Following Israeli strikes , Hamas might need months , and in certain areas , years to rebuild its strength . Hamas , including its naval commando , were hit hard . Overall , Israel managed to inflict Hamas quite a blow in this round .
& nbsp ;
Israel theorizes that more strikes in the current round will be adequate to cripple the military wing of Hamas , delaying another round , but there is no guarantee of that . Hamas will still have a capability to challenge Israel .
& nbsp ;
This round started following clashes in Jerusalem , which are capable of occurring again at any time for a variety of reasons . Israel needs to be careful in this matter , but predicting in advance what will ignite riots , let alone another round with Hamas , is a speculative undertaking . The latter can easily rely on friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem as an excuse for striking Israel , producing yet another extended campaign .
& nbsp ;
Hamas is an Iranian proxy , although independent in many respects . Its self - determination has been demonstrated in several instances , such as when it refused to fight for Assad , Iran & rsquo ; s ally , during the Syrian civil war . Nevertheless , Iran recognizes the importance of Hamas due to its location , near Israel , and since it is Sunni . The mostly Shi & rsquo ; ite Iran uses this religious factor to present itself as one that assists Sunnis , and not only Shi & rsquo ; ite groups such as Hezbollah .
& nbsp ;
IN RECENT YEARS , Iranian training and knowledge helped Hamas upgrade its missiles and rockets , with the results being shown in this latest round . Iran hereby hits Israel indirectly , as part of the ongoing conflict between them . Israel returns the favor by bombing Iranian targets inside Syria , and by conducting covert operations against Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program .
& nbsp ;
Israel & rsquo ; s most crucial national security concern is stopping or at least delaying the development of Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . It is a top priority for Israel , more important than any issue Israel has with Hamas or any other national security concern for that matter .
& nbsp ;
Talks between Iran , the United States , and other powers about containing Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program are ongoing . Israel does not have much leverage in those negotiations , but as long as Israel is occupied with Hamas , Israel cannot focus on what matters most : handling Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . In that sense , Hamas serves Iran even if Hamas fights Israel for its own reasons . This is another major reason why Israel should end the current campaign with Hamas .
& nbsp ;
Israel and the United States have close ties , but the Biden administration does not have very friendly relations with the Israeli government . Israel needs its American patron in order to reach the best outcome for the current round with Hamas . Israel relies much more on the United States to make sure the talks with Iran will be effective at restraining Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program .
& nbsp ;
If Israel annoys the Biden administration with respect to the Gaza Strip , the United States might be less willing to listen to Israel about Iran . The Biden administration lends Israel time in fighting Hamas but it is clear the Biden administration wants this campaign to subside . If Israel insists on persisting with this round , it risks increasing friction with the Biden administration .
The Gaza Strip has been under the rule of Hamas since 2007 .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas , due to its mismanagement and eagerness to confront Israel , caused a deep economic and social crisis in the Gaza Strip . Some predict that this area might collapse , driving thousands of desperate Palestinians to infiltrate Israel and ask for help . Obviously , Israel does not prefer this outcome . If Israel continues with this round , the probability of further decline in the Gaza Strip increases .
& nbsp ;
Many Arab states oppose Hamas , and some , like those in the Gulf , have ties with Israel . Arab states can & rsquo ; t openly support Israel in this round , fearing public opinion inside their countries and across the Arab world . Arab criticism of Israel is not as pronounced as it used to be , but this can easily change for the worse . The longer this round is continued , the higher the burden of casualties amongst the Palestinian population will reach , forcing even Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel , to speak and maybe even to act against Israel .
& nbsp ;
All in all , ending the current campaign will frustrate many in Israel who wish to defeat Hamas . However , Israel should cut its losses , and not extend this campaign , because it is simply not worth the cost and the risks .
