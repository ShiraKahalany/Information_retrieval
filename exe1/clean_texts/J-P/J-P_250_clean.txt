Yesh Din alleged that the Jewish extremists threw stones at Palestinians and their homes in Jalud , vandalized vehicles and chased a four - year - old Palestinian boy who was in the yard of his home . They also set fire to the fields around the village and these were only extinguished in the morning .

Yesh Din executive director Lior Amihai said , & ldquo ; Last night , we witnessed a revenge pogrom by violent settlers that was made possible only because the apartheid regime encouraged it .
