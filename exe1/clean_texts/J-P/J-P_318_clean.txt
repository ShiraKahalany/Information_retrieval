These women , the UN said , have traditionally been left & ldquo ; unseen , unsupported , and unmeasured .& rdquo ; What is International Widows Day ? The day was dedicated to widows in 2011 , and is used as & ldquo ; an opportunity for action towards achieving full rights and recognition for widows . This includes provision of information on access to a fair share of their inheritance , pensions and social protection beyond what is owed on the basis of marital status alone . It promises decent work and equal pay , education and training opportunities . Empowering widows to support themselves and their families also means addressing social stigmas that create exclusion , and discriminatory or harmful practices .& rdquo ;
