Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz , an observer on the security cabinet , called for the IDF to temporarily take over Gaza for a few weeks in order to disarm Hamas , in an interview with Ynet on Wednesday .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; We will have no escape one day from a temporary takeover of Gaza , which has heavy prices ,& quot ; said Steinitz to Ynet . & quot ; This day did not come for all sorts of reasons . I think this day will come , if not now , then in the coming years .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
& quot ; No one will disarm Hamas unless we do it by force ,& quot ; added Steinitz . & quot ; This idea of taking over Gaza to completely dismantle terrorist organizations has heavy costs . That is why I understand the people who think differently from me and who object to the idea of one day doing a ground invasion and the collapse of the Hamas regime .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
Steinitz added that Israel should declare a unilateral ceasefire without an agreement with Hamas , saying that the terrorist group wouldn @@@ t follow any agreement in any case .
& nbsp ;
Concerning how long he believes the operation will continue , Steinitz stressed that he wouldn @@@ t make a statement on the matter as the & quot ; last thing that I want to do is provide the other side with a schedule .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
The statements come amid reports in Israeli and international media claiming that Israel and Hamas were nearing an agreement on a ceasefire that would begin on Thursday .
& nbsp ;
Hamas official Izzat Reshiq tweeted on Tuesday night that the reports of a ceasefire were not true and that no agreement had been reached , adding that & quot ; the efforts and discussions of the mediators are serious and continuous , and the demands of our people are clear and known .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
During a briefing for ambassadors in Israel on Wednesday , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed that Israeli is & quot ; not standing with a stopwatch , but rather is concerned with meeting goals .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
Community Affairs Minister and security cabinet member Tzachi Hanegbi told KAN Reshet Bet radio on Wednesday that & quot ; Israel is not engaged with a ceasefire , but in firing . The IDF has many other goals and missions & mdash ; for many days and weeks .& quot ; Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis told Army Radio that the operation is continuing and that there is & quot ; nothing related to a ceasefire .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
A person involved in the ceasefire talks told Army Radio on Wednesday that there are currently no negotiations on a truce and that Egyptian efforts to reach a ceasefire are ongoing .

A senior official in Jerusalem said on Tuesday that while the IDF has had major successes in striking Hamas , it has many more targets it wants to hit .

Since the beginning of the fighting , close to 3 , 500 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip toward Israel , with some 500 falling short and landing inside the coastal enclave .
