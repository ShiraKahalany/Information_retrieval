& nbsp ; The Supreme Court has ordered World Vision Operations Manager Mohammad El Halabi to remain in detention until at least May 19 , pending the verdict in his trial on charges of assisting Hamas on a variety of fronts .
& nbsp ;
In a Tuesday decision only now being reported , Justice Menachem Mazuz said that Halabi both posed a danger and was a flight risk , which , along with the case moving toward a conclusion , meant the courts should not release him to house arrest .
& nbsp ;
With four - and - half - years having passed since Halabi was indicted in the Beersheba District Court , it is still unclear when there will be a verdict about whether he was a humanitarian who has been unfairly targeted or working with Hamas or both .
& nbsp ;
Updates from Halabi & rsquo ; s lawyer , Maher Hana , and the Justice Ministry have indicated that closing arguments were scheduled for March 3 .
& nbsp ;
However , Hana argued to Mazuz that the closing arguments and the district court & rsquo ; s deliberation and composing of the verdict could still see Halabi held in detention far beyond May 19 .
& nbsp ;
Supporters of Halabi have also said that the prosecution at earlier stages in the case had offered a three year jail sentence as part of a plea bargain .
& nbsp ;
In that light , Halabi having to serve already five years and remain in prison for a continued indefinite period would make little sense since even a conviction could lead to his release based on time already served .
& nbsp ;
Mazuz responded saying that motions filed by Hana had caused many of the delays since the prosecution concluded its case back in April 2018 .
& nbsp ;
The Supreme Court justice also said that the trial had been robust including the calling of over 40 witnesses and a mini - trial on aspects of the evidence .
& nbsp ;
Halabi was indicted in August 2016 for allegedly using World Vision as a front for smuggling $ 7 . 2 million a year to Hamas for buying weapons and building attack tunnels .
& nbsp ;
This was instead of being used by the humanitarian organization for food , humanitarian assistance , and aid programs for disabled children as earmarked .
& nbsp ;
The indictment said that World Vision operated in 100 countries and employed 46 , 000 people , but had fallen victim to a complex Hamas takeover scheme led by Halabi .
& nbsp ;
At the time , World Vision denied the allegations and said it was & ldquo ; shocked & rdquo ; since it had regular internal and independent audits and evaluations as well as a broad range of internal controls to ensure aid reached intended beneficiaries .
& nbsp ;
NGO Monitor has filed detailed reports to critique these audits as inadequate and for avoiding asking tougher questions about dual use items which could look innocent on paper , but which could be used by Hamas .
& nbsp ;
Eventually , Australia , which was funding the World Vision Gaza project , cut its funding , though an audit its government performed did not find the wrongdoing allegedly uncovered by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ).
& nbsp ;
Despite being indicted in August 2016 , it is still unclear when there will be a verdict from the Beersheba District Court .
& nbsp ;
In addition , the legal proceedings themselves have been rife with irregularities in restricting evidence and how Halabi & rsquo ; s lawyer maintains information he learns during the closed proceedings much more typical of Israel & rsquo ; s military courts than what is typical in Israeli civilian courts .
& nbsp ;
In April 2018 and again in July 2020 , the High Court of Justice rejected Hana & rsquo ; s request to intervene in the case to compel the prosecution to play by more standard civilian court rules .
