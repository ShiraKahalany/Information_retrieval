The UN Security Council must pressure Israel to halt the pending eviction of 3 , 000 Palestinians living in east Jerusalem including in & nbsp ; Sheikh Jarrah , Ir Amim executive - director Yehudith Oppenheimer urged in a special briefing she delivered to the 15 - member body .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It is therefore essential to hold the Israeli government accountable , and to urge it to prevent the large - scale displacement of these communities ,& rdquo ; said Oppenheimer , who heads an Israeli left - wing NGO that focuses almost exclusively on issues relating to east Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
Oppenheimer spoke to the UNSC virtually from Jerusalem during its monthly meeting on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict . She briefly outlined issues relating to the 350 , 000 Palestinians who are residents of the city , but not citizens of the country .
& nbsp ;
Since 1967 , & ldquo ; Israeli authorities have employed a system of discriminatory policies to weaken the Palestinian hold on the city ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer charged . & ldquo ; These policies have included : land confiscation , settlement [ Jewish ] building , denial of citizenship and political rights , permanent residency revocation , insufficient service provision & nbsp ; and severe restrictions on planning and building in east Jerusalem .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
But Oppenheimer focused specifically on the fate of four small communities in east Jerusalem , where some 3 , 000 Palestinians are & nbsp ; in danger of losing their homes ; Sheikh Jarrah , Batan al - Hawa , Bustan and Walaja .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I am speaking because these measures of Palestinian displacement have recently increased in scope and scale in an unprecedented manner ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer said .
& nbsp ;
At issue are four legal battles ; two involve city plans to build two national parks and the others involve landlord - tenant disputes over land ownership and the legality of the homes .
& nbsp ;
The most high - profile dispute has been the fate of four families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood , also known as the Shimon HaTzaddik neighborhood .
& nbsp ;
The four families have appealed to the High Court of Justice to overrule two lower court rulings , which determined that their homes are owned by the Nahalat Shimon Company that wants to develop the largely Palestinian neighborhood for Jewish housing .
& nbsp ;
The area had been a Jewish one prior to the 1948 War of Independence when the residents fled . In the aftermath of the war , Palestinians who fled sovereign Israel , including west Jerusalem , moved to that area .
& nbsp ;
Some 28 families were offered homes there in exchange for relinquishing their refugee status . But the land , previously owned by two Jewish companies , was not registered in their names .
& nbsp ;
The High Court of Justice is expected to hold a hearing on the appeal on Monday . It had initially delayed the hearing to give Attorney - General Avichai Mandelblit time to determine if the government wanted to be a party to the case and to render an option .
& nbsp ;
Mandelblit told the court earlier this month that he saw no reason for the state to intervene , and threw the matter back to the court .
& nbsp ;
A source told The Jerusalem Post that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett would not order the eviction of the Sheikh Jarrah families . Police have the option to refuse eviction orders that might cause a danger to security .
& nbsp ;
Hamas has claimed that Sheikh Jarrah is one of the reasons that it launched a salvo of rockets at Jerusalem and other towns in May , which sparked an 11 - day Gaza war .
& nbsp ;
Bennett & rsquo ; s opposition to the demolitions is likely to delay the matter , possibly for a long time , but it could not ultimately subvert the legal process should the High Court rule against the families .
& nbsp ;
It is believed that the fate of the petition by the four families will determine the fate of the remaining 24 families in the neighborhood at risk of losing their homes .
& nbsp ;
Ambassador to the US and the UN Gilad Erdan attacked Oppenheimer when he addressed the council , charging that she had brought & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s lies about Jerusalem to the Security Council .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
It & rsquo ; s a move , he said , which & ldquo ; strengthens the terrorist organization and weakens the Palestinian Authority ,& rdquo ; and that it is an & ldquo ; absurd & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; dangerous & rdquo ; situation .
& nbsp ;
Erdan warned that the & ldquo ; Hamas narrative & rdquo ; put forward by Oppenheimer could be used to justify terror attacks against Israel .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Today & rsquo ; s discussion might serve to increase Hamas & rsquo ; influence in Jerusalem and the Palestinian arena ,& rdquo ; Erdan said .
& nbsp ;
He charged that Ir Amim had a & ldquo ; long history of spreading distorted claims regarding Israel & rsquo ; s legitimacy and presence in Jerusalem , while ignoring inconvenient facts .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Erdan claimed that more than & ldquo ; half of Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship to Palestinian citizenship .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Far from being displaced , Erdan said , & ldquo ; Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Arab population has increased by over 400 % since Jerusalem was reunited in 1967 .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
An Ir Amim briefing to the council , he said , is & ldquo ; as absurd as bringing a leader of the Yellow Vests protests to give an & lsquo ; objective & rsquo ; briefing on the French Government & rsquo ; s economic policy .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Neither the NGO nor the Security Council can undermine the & ldquo ; millennia - old connection between the Jewish People and its eternal capital of Jerusalem .& rdquo ; He added , & ldquo ; We will always keep that promise .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Despite & ldquo ; false claims to the contrary , we will never accept the delegitimization of our legal , historical and national rights in Jerusalem , by the Security Council or any other international body ,& rdquo ; Erdan said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Successive Israeli governments had framed these cases as standard property disputes ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer explained to the UNSC , but that in reality they were & ldquo ; systematic campaigns & rdquo ; aimed at changing the demographic makeup of east Jerusalem . This is done by uprooting Palestinian families and supplanting them with Jewish enclaves within larger Palestinian neighborhoods , Oppenheimer said , adding that it & rsquo ; s a situation that creates friction and makes normative communal neighborhood life difficult .
& nbsp ;
The situation is possible because of the discriminatory legal system that allows Jews to reclaim property lost as the result of the 1948 war , but forbids Palestinians from reclaiming property they lost in that war .
& nbsp ;
The & ldquo ; pretexts for many of the demolitions are the absence of building permits , which are nearly impossible to procure due to the absence of proper zoning plans that the Israeli authorities have failed to advance ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Many of the families facing evictions are Palestinian refugees who lost homes in 1948 , and who now stand to be displaced for a second time ,& rdquo ; she claimed .
& nbsp ;
Oppenheimer also highlighted the case of Batan al - Hawa in Silwan , noting that the court had asked Mandelblit to provide a response by August 29 . The request indicates & ldquo ; a possible understanding that these cases have far - reaching political and moral ramifications and therefore require & nbsp ; government involvement ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer said , adding that & ldquo ; the Israeli government is now being compelled to take an explicit position on these eviction proceedings .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
That is why international pressure is so important at this juncture , she said .
