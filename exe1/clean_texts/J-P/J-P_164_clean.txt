Aljazeera @@@ s English website retracted a story on Wednesday about an Emirates pilot who reportedly resigned to protest normalization between the & nbsp ; United Arab Emirates and Israel in the wake of the Abraham Accords . 

Ghanem Nuseibeh , Founder of Cornerstone Global Associates and chairman of the Muslims Against Antisemitism ( MAAS ) organization , reported the retraction on Twitter , adding that he was himself a victim of Aljazeera @@@ s misinformation and fake news . He said that he finds it & quot ; unsettling that the channel continues to peddle antisemitic stories , like BDS ,& quot ; and called on Aljazeera to apologize .

He continued , saying that although he was glad the fake news had been taken down , & quot ; the damage done , however , is that the antisemitic story is spreading widely in Arabic speaking circles .& quot ; 


As a victim of Aljazeera misinformation and fake news , I find it very unsettling that the channel continues to peddle anti Semitic stories , like BDS . Aljazeera needs to be challenged until it stops this incitement

On its website , Aljazeera in English gave the following reason for its action under an Editor @@@ s Note : & quot ; The text in this page originally showed a news story about an alleged Tunisian pilot , Monem al - Taba , who reportedly claimed in a Facebook post he was suspended by the UAE flag carrier Emirates for refusing to fly to Tel Aviv . Emirates has since commented via Twitter saying it & ldquo ; has never employed any pilot by this name and all reports circulating on social media around this are false .& quot ;

& quot ; We have therefore retracted the story pending further review .& quot ;

Following the Abraham Accords , Israel and the United Arab Emirates will allow visa - free travel between the countries , after the UAE ratified an agreement on the matter on Wednesday .

Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said & ldquo ; the ratification of the agreement is a central element of the full and quick implementation of the many agreements being worked on these days with the Emirates , Bahrain and Morocco .& rdquo ;
