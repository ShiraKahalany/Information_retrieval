Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday called on Canada and the international community to & ldquo ; stop Israeli aggressions that violate international law .& rdquo ; He made the appeal during a meeting in Ramallah with Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau .
& nbsp ;
Garneau & rsquo ; s visit to Ramallah came as Abbas continues to face widespread criticism over the death of anti - corruption activist Nizar Banat , who was reportedly beaten to death by PA security officers in Hebron on June 24 .
& nbsp ;
In the past week , thousands of Palestinians have taken to the streets to demand Abbas @@@ s removal from office . The protesters have also demanded that those responsible for the death of Banat be brought to justice .
& nbsp ;
The visit also comes amid a stepped - up crackdown by PA security forces on political activists , social media users and journalists in the West Bank .
& nbsp ;
The Representative Office of Canada in Ramallah last week said it was & ldquo ; deeply concerned by the attacks on Palestinians protesting the death of Nizar Banat , as well as the unacceptable attacks on journalists covering the protests .& rdquo ; It called on the PA to take immediate steps to ensure that freedoms of assembly and expression are respected and protected .
& nbsp ;
Abbas told Garneau that the Palestinians are prepared to return to the political process with Israel & ldquo ; to end the occupation and achieve comprehensive peace , in accordance with international resolutions , under the auspices of the Quartet & rdquo ; members & ndash ; the US , Russia , the United Nations and the European Union .
& nbsp ;
Abbas stressed the importance of having a political horizon and giving hope to the Palestinians , according to the PA & rsquo ; s official news agency WAFA .
& nbsp ;
It said that Abbas emphasized the need to expedite the process of rebuilding the Gaza Strip and providing aid to the Palestinians .
& nbsp ;
Abbas told Garneau that the PA government in Ramallah is prepared to contribute to the reconstruction effort and work towards ending the division between the West Bank and the Hamas - ruled coastal enclave .
& nbsp ;
He also expressed appreciation for Canada & rsquo ; s support & ldquo ; for the right of the Palestinians to self - determination , its opposition to settlement expansion , its refusal to expel Palestinians from their homes in east Jerusalem , and its repeated calls for respecting the historical situation in religious sites ,& rdquo ; WAFA added .
& nbsp ;
Abbas also thanked Canada for the humanitarian aid it provides to the Gaza Strip , the support provided to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ), and its assistance in combating the coronavirus epidemic .
& nbsp ;
Abbas told his Canadian guest that he will call new general elections as soon as Israel agrees to allow a vote in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
In April , Abbas called off the parliamentary and presidential elections that were supposed to take place respectively on May 22 and July 31 , under the pretext that Israel did not reply to the Palestinians & rsquo ; request to hold the elections in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
WAFA quoted Garneau as saying that Canada was opposed to the & ldquo ; expulsion of Palestinian residents from their homes in east Jerusalem and the importance of respecting religious sites ,& rdquo ; as well as its rejection of settlements .
& nbsp ;
Garneau also expressed Canada & rsquo ; s keenness to establish peace in the region , its commitment to achieving peace based on the principle of the two - state solution , establishing security and stability and continuing to provide relief and assistance to UNRWA , the agency said .
& nbsp ;
PA Foreign Minister Riyad Malki , who also met with Garneau , accused Israel of & ldquo ; waging war & rdquo ; on Palestinians in Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank , which is exclusively controlled by Israel . Malki told the Canadian foreign minister that the international community must & ldquo ; protect the rights of the Palestinians , including the right to self - determination .& rdquo ;
