Peace Now and Jordan Valley Activists have filed a petition to the High Court for the eviction of Moshe Sharvit & rsquo ; s outpost following the international sanctions imposed against him , the two organizations announced last week .& nbsp ; The organizations demand that the state enforce demolition orders against the structures in the illegal outpost , which is named & ldquo ; Moshe & rsquo ; s Farm & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; Emek Tirzah Farm .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; The organizations charge that since its establishment , the outpost has been a hub of violence and harassment against Palestinian shepherd communities . Peace Now is an Israeli organization dedicated to promoting a two - state solution to solve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians .& ldquo ; Settler violence in these agricultural outposts is not a bug , it & rsquo ; s a feature . The government supports these outposts , nurtures them , and allows them to seize land and expel Palestinian residents from the entire area . The government does nothing to stop these crimes , and it & rsquo ; s time for the court to compel it to enforce the law ,& rdquo ; Peace Now asserted .& nbsp ; Peace Now claims that some Palestinian families were forced to flee their homes due to threats and harassment from the outpost & rsquo ; s residents .& nbsp ; Recently , the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada have imposed sanctions on the farm and its founder , Moshe Sharvit .& nbsp ; Response to international sanctionsIn response to the sanctions , Sharvit told the right - wing news organization , Arutz Sheva & ndash ; Israel National News , & ldquo ; If Britain has recognized my endeavors , who am I to say anything ? When the nations of the world focus on a specific point , it seems that this is a sign that we must take action and increase it .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; He then added , & ldquo ; Whoever chooses to harm us is committing a personal action , and I believe that this is an anti - Jewish act . These sanctions were imposed not only on me but also on Harel , a soldier who fell heroically for the Land of Israel and the people of Israel .& rdquo ; He is referring to Capt . ( res .) Harel Sharvit , his brother , who fell in Gaza .& ldquo ; Moshe Sharvit repeatedly harassed , threatened , and attacked Palestinian civilians and Israeli human rights defenders in the vicinity of Moshes Farm , an outpost in the West Bank ,& rdquo ; the US State Department said in a statement , explaining why Sharvit and his farm have been sanctioned .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; In October 2023 , Sharvit issued a threat against the residents of the Palestinian village of Ein Shibli , and while armed , ordered them to leave their homes ; this threat resulted in up to 100 Palestinian civilians fleeing their village in fear for their lives ,& rdquo ; the statement added .& nbsp ; Moshe Sharvit established an agricultural farm in the Jordan Valley , approximately 1 . 5 kilometers southeast of the Hamra community . In 2021 , the Civil Administration issued a demolition order for all the structures built without permits or approved building plans . Despite the orders , the farm continued to expand , and as of 2024 , it included a guest lodge for travelers and an event complex , indicating that the outpost makes a profit from tourism . According to its website , the farm can accommodate up to 100 people .& nbsp ; An organization titled the Jordan Valley Activists group , composed of Israeli volunteers has begun accompanying Palestinian shepherds and documenting attacks against them to have evidence for the police .& nbsp ; The Jordan Valley Activist group claims it has hundreds of incidents of harassment and violence by the farm residents and has filed dozens of complaints to the police .& nbsp ;
