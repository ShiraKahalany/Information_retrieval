Local Palestinian leader Mohammed Nasser of Dura has been called a traitor for speaking with Israelis . He was not afraid , therefore , to attend a kosher iftar meal in the West Bank city of Hebron with Israeli guests , including settler leaders from the city & rsquo ; s Jewish community .& ldquo ; If you mention Mohammed Nasser in the West Bank , they will tell you he is the first man for Israel ,& rdquo ; Nasser told the several dozen guests who sat on the porch of Hebron businessman Ashraf Jabari on Tuesday night . A veteran peacemaker , Nasser has spoken with Israeli presidents , prime ministers , parliamentarians , congressmen , writers , and poets . He has also traveled to Washington to advocate for peace . Nasser said he is in conversation with South Hebron Hills Regional Council Yohai Damri and has spoken with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Ram Ben - Barak .& ldquo ; I know each and every president of Israel , even prime ministers ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; Either they were at my home or I met them in their offices ,& rdquo ; he told the several dozen guests at the iftar meal , which offered kosher guests meals prepared in the nearby Kiryat Arba settlement . An electrician by trade , Nasser recalled how in 1982 when he was & ldquo ; chief of the village league ,& rdquo ; he called for a conference under the & ldquo ; slogan & lsquo ; yes to peace & rsquo ;.& rdquo ; Even the Israelis were concerned he was a traitor , Nasser recalled . Nasser explained that these ties have come at a cost . & ldquo ; We are suffering a lot because of our relationship with you ,& rdquo ; he said .& ldquo ; You will enjoy the night and you will go back , but everyone in the area will start saying Ashraf Jabari , he received Jews , he is a quisling [ traitor ].& rdquo ;& ldquo ; You have to protect those people who have sympathy with you [& hellip ;] I ask you to support those people who are saying peace to you ,& rdquo ; Nasser advised . The event was hosted by both Jabari and the Judea and Samaria Chamber of Commerce , of which he and Ariel resident Avi Zimmerman are co - founders . Jabari began the tradition of a kosher Iftar in 2019 when US President Donald Trump was in the White House and saw Palestinians like Jabari as grassroots alternatives to the Palestinian Authority . That same year Jabari ignored a PA ban and attended the US - sponsored economic conference in Bahrain . Jabari & rsquo ; s first iftar included a number of Israeli - Arab business people . In 2020 , he held a virtual iftar event and last year there were a number of Yesha members at the meal . Hebron has a bitter history of Israeli - Palestinian violence , but on Jabari & rsquo ; s porch , he and his Muslim and Jewish guests showed another side of relations in the city . Members of the Hebron Jewish community have attended each of Jabari & rsquo ; s four iftar celebrations . One of its spokespeople , Yishai Fleisher , recalled for the guests on Tuesday how Jabari had helped him fulfill his mother & rsquo ; s wish to have fireworks explode over the Tomb of the Patriarchs in honor of his daughter & rsquo ; s bat mitzvah , which occurred just before the advent of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Fleisher recalls that when those in the bat mitzvah party saw the night sky light up they said : & ldquo ;& rsquo ; What a coincidence .& rsquo ; I said , & lsquo ; No , I organized this , I have friends on the Arab side & rsquo ; and they said , & lsquo ; No , no , you don & rsquo ; t , you are joking .& rsquo ;& rdquo ; The guests didn & rsquo ; t believe him , Fleisher recalls , but the friendship is very real .& ldquo ; For us , this relationship is very important ,& rdquo ; Fleisher said . & ldquo ; Maybe for Ashraf it & rsquo ; s important , but , for us , maybe it & rsquo ; s more important . A lot of people around the world want to accuse us of racism and want to say that we hate Arabs . No , we hate jihadists . We hate people who want to make war against us .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; There is a lot of joint activity the two communities can do together to improve the city ,& rdquo ; Fleisher said , adding that people like Jabari make such joint activity possible . Attorney Kobi Kamar of Jerusalem , invited by a friend , said he had imagined that he was going to a left - wing event and found himself instead in a room of right - wingers .& ldquo ; I have found here a reality I had not imagined ,& rdquo ; he said , explaining that it was a reality that did not conform to the stereotypes . Hebron Jewish community spokesman Noam Arnon said that Jews and Muslims had been neighbors in Hebron for centuries and were neighbors as well today .& ldquo ; We have to make sure that the future of this area will be a future of peace ,& rdquo ; Arnon said . Given the biblical roots of the city that date back to Abraham , Hebron could be a thriving tourist city , Arnon said . Zimmerman said it was important to emphasize that the ties that brought Jews and Muslims together on the porch were those of & ldquo ; neighbor to neighbor .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; The idea that the rest of the world is looking at this region as Palestinians and settlers doesn & rsquo ; t help anyone understand the reality of neighbor to neighbor ,& rdquo ; he said .
