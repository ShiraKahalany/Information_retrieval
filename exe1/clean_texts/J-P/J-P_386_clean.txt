International Criminal Court Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on Wednesday threatened both Israel and Hamas with new possible war crimes allegations relating to the ongoing conflict .
& nbsp ;
In a series of tweets , Bensouda wrote , & ldquo ; I note with great concern the escalation of violence in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , as well as in and around Gaza , and the possible commission of crimes under the # RomeStatute .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Further , she wrote , & ldquo ; I echo the call from the international community for calm , restraint & amp ; a stop to the violence .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Next , she said , & ldquo ; I recall that my Office & rsquo ; s investigations will cover all sides and all the facts and evidence relevant to an assessment of whether there is individual criminal responsibility under the Statute . My Office will continue to monitor developments on the ground and will factor any matter that falls within its jurisdiction .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
In February and March , the ICC Pre - Trial Chamber and Bensouda herself each made decisions pushing forward with a full criminal probe of Israel & rsquo ; s and Hamas & rsquo ; s conduct .
& nbsp ;
Regarding Israel , Bensouda was already probing the 2014 Gaza war , the 2018 Gaza border conflict and the settlement enterprise .
& nbsp ;
With regard to Hamas , she was probing the 2014 and 2018 conflicts .
& nbsp ;
However , once an ICC probe is launched , it is open - ended and can add new events into the investigation as they occur .
& nbsp ;
Bensouda & rsquo ; s tweets on Wednesday were a reminder to Israel and Hamas that for the first time ever , the current major conflict is taking place in the middle of an already ongoing full ICC criminal probe .
& nbsp ;
Back in 2014 , there was no ICC process in place , and the former prosecutor , Luis Moreno - Ocampo , had rejected jurisdiction over & ldquo ; Palestine & rdquo ; in early 2012 .
& nbsp ;
However , by late 2012 , the & ldquo ; State of Palestine & rdquo ; received a heightened nation , nonmember state status from the UN General Assembly .
& nbsp ;
In early 2015 , the Palestinian Authority used this new status to request a probe of Israel , and Bensouda spent the next five years carrying out a preliminary review of the issue .
& nbsp ;
Between December 2019 and February of this year , the issue was litigated before the ICC Pre - Trial Chamber , which eventually endorsed Bensouda & rsquo ; s moving to the next stage , the full criminal probe .
& nbsp ;
Previously , Bensouda issued warnings to Israel over the 2018 Gaza border conflict and over a plan to evict the residents of Khan al - Ahmar .
& nbsp ;
Israel indefinitely postponed the eviction of Khan al - Ahmar residents , and the IDF acknowledged that it altered some of its tactics during the 2018 conflict .
& nbsp ;
But neither of those situations came anywhere near the magnitude of the current conflict , which could expose Israel on a much greater level .
& nbsp ;
Israel rejects ICC jurisdiction on a variety of grounds , ranging from rejecting the idea of Palestine being a state , the IDF & rsquo ; s self - investigating mechanisms superseding any ICC probe , the fact that Israel never ratified the Rome Statute , and the idea that building houses in the disputed West Bank cannot be a war crime , and is an issue for peace negotiations .
& nbsp ;
Bensouda steps down next month and will be replaced by Karim Khan , who Israel hopes may be more sympathetic to its views , but who to date is an unknown variable .
