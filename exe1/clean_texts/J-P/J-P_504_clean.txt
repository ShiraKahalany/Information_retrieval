There are large gaps in trust between Israelis , Palestinians and Arab - Israelis across Israel and the Palestinian territories , according to a recent survey by Tel Aviv University ( TAU ).

& quot ; Unsurprisingly , the Jewish public expressed very high levels of distrust towards the Palestinians in Gaza ( 85 %) and on the West Bank ( 84 %),& quot ; TAU said in its report . & quot ; But still , these are a bit lower than the level of total distrust of Hamas ( 97 %). Among respondents in the Jewish public , there is also distrust of Arabs who are citizens of Israel , except among left - wingers , as three - quarters of them expressed trust in Arab citizens of Israel .& quot ;

In comparison , mistrust of Palestinians and Arab - Israelis by the Jewish public is at & quot ; higher levels & quot ; than that of the Arab public @@@ s perception of the Jewish public , which is reported to be at more & quot ; moderate & quot ; levels .

While the majority of respondents relayed their willingness to close said gap , by strengthening equality and cooperation between the sides , Jewish respondents feel a need to strengthen & quot ; Jewish control & quot ; over the region following the most recent escalation and civil unrest that plagued the country in May & mdash ; Although that notion had low support from the left - wing Israeli supporters . Arab - Israeli respondents showed clear support ( 75 %) for increasing equality among the Jewish and Arab groups .

& quot ; In contrast , the Arab public expressed more ambivalence regarding their level of trust for all three of the groups mentioned , but among those who expressed opinions , a majority ( 61 %) expressed distrust of Jewish citizens of Israel ,& quot ; TAU explained .

Zoning in on relations between the two opposing groups , a larger majority of the Jewish public are for further coordination with Arab - Israeli citizens and Palestinians alike & mdash ; except those who stand in right - wing camps , who held split opinions on such a step . Arab - Israeli respondents additionally expressed their support ( 71 %) for further cooperation between the groups and an opposition to separating the groups , although stood divided on policies that would increase Israeli control across the region .

& quot ; Most of the left and center ( 95 % and 83 % respectively ) support increased equality for the two groups , while half of the moderate right - wing support such moves ,& quot ; TAU said . & quot ; Among the right - wing , only 28 % expressed support .

& quot ; Similar data appear for the four ideological Jewish groups , regarding the level of opposition to an increase in separation between Arabs and Jews ( 85 %, 65 %, 55 %, and 27 % respectively ).& quot ; 

With regard to the widespread civil unrest that plagued the country during the most recent IDF operation in the Gaza Strip , half of the Israeli public was under the belief that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to deal with the violence properly , nor did they believe the violence was justified but instead instigated by Palestinians and Arab - Israelis holding positions of influence across the region , while the Arab public believed Netanyahu fueled the strife .

Right - wing ( 81 %) and moderate right - wing ( 74 %) Israeli supporters both shared the belief that Netanyahu did not want to exacerbate the recent civil unrest that stormed through the mixed - cities across the country , while left - wing supporters ( 82 %) and centrists ( 69 %) thought the exact opposite & mdash ; displaying the mirror image of both camps with regard to the former prime minister . Similarly , although displaying further gaps in opinions , right - wing camps believed Netanyahu did well to quell the violence while left - wing Israelis in greater majorities believed that he aggravated the situation .

The general Arab public tended to hold similar views with the left - wing camps across Israel , that instead of stamping out the violence , Netanyahu incited it to further the operation in Gaza . Both Arab and Jewish sectors did , however , agree that the violence was unjustified and only furthered the divide between the two sides .

When asked about the IDF @@@ s Operation Guardian of the Wall , around half of the Jewish public believes Israel & quot ; achieved more significant gains than Hamas in the recent fighting .& quot ; This is despite the feeling that the world perceives the operation as being of a & nbsp ; & quot ; disproportionate nature .& quot ; A larger majority supports further military operations to bring the total collapse of Hamas in the Gaza Strip or long - term solution to the ongoing conflict . & quot ; Most of the Arab public support a long - term solution ( 57 %), but a third did not express their opinion ,& quot ; TAU said .

The most common answer given , however , across the Arab sector was that they & quot ; did not know & quot ; who gained the upper hand in the fighting , and with regard to international opinion surrounding how the conflict played out , they are evenly divided on how the world views Israel in the aftermath of the violence believing that many countries still support the Jewish State regardless .

In the context of future negotiations and peace arrangements with the Palestinians , there has been some opposition to & quot ; maintaining the present situation in comparison to previous surveys ,& quot ; with many reconsidering their positions on the decades - long conflict , meaning that while a larger portion of the public prefer a one - state solution , the majority still supports a two - state & mdash ; as well as additional considerations regarding annexation and a binational coexistence .

& quot ; Among the respondents , most on the left ( 55 %) and on the right ( 53 %) responded that it had not led to reconsideration , while among the moderate right and the center , most answered positively ,& quot ; said TAU in its report . & quot ; People on the right who responded that they were reconsidering their opinions were divided between those who said that they were weighing whether to support a military solution ( 33 %) and those who stated that they were thinking about supporting an agreed upon political solution ( 16 %).& quot ;

Centrists responded more commonly to a political solution ( 37 %), and in contrast , about a third of the Arab public did not respond , while about a quarter said they would consider & quot ; supporting an agreed upon political solution .& quot ;

& quot ; Despite the growing dissatisfaction with the existing situation , there is no sign of change , when compared to the previous index , in answers to the question of which solution has the highest probability of being achieved , as in the last index , continuing the present situation is the most frequent reply in the sample ( 46 %),& quot ; TAU explained .

Noting the new unity government headed by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid , which is without a leader currently on trial for public corruption ( i . e . Netanyahu ), two - thirds of the respondents to the survey are categorically for a law that would prevent those accused of a criminal act from serving as prime minister .

& quot ; The data received indicates stability , when contrasted to the previous index , in support of a law to prevent those accused of criminal activity from serving as prime minister ( 66 % in contrast to 65 %), including broad support among right - wing voters ( 69 %),& quot ; TAU noted . & quot ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s proposal for direct elections for prime minister also gains wide support among the right - wing ( 87 %) and from the moderate right ( 71 %), compared to opposition from the centrists ( 63 %) and from the left - wing ( 82 %).& quot ;
