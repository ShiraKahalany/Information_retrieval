& ldquo ; We really have to think out of the box , because the post - October 7 reality puts us in a completely new world , breaking misconceptions , and building new realities ,& rdquo ; said Dr . Dan Diker , President of the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference on Monday . Diker & rsquo ; s observation prefaced a discussion he conducted at the conference with Mossab Hassan Yousef , & nbsp ;& ldquo ; the Green Prince ,& rdquo ; son of Hamas co - founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef . Yousef defected to Israel in 1997 and worked as a spy for the Shin Bet until he moved to the United States in 2007 .& nbsp ; Diker characterized the Hamas attack of October 7 as a & ldquo ; strategic surprise & rdquo ; along the lines of major events such as 911 and Pearl Harbor . & ldquo ; At the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , what shocked us was the glee , the energy , and the enthusiasm for Hamas in the free world ,& rdquo ; he said .& nbsp ; He described the expectations in the US and much of the Western alliance that supports the creation of a Palestinian state & ldquo ; on the heels of the worst massacre and mass murder in modern political history on a single day of any democratic country . & ldquo ; The free world , in large part , believes that this [ the war ] is an extension of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict . Our understanding , and Israel & rsquo ; s understanding as a national consensus issue is completely different .& rdquo ; Diker noted that in the eyes of many in the West , & ldquo ; Israel has been recast as Hamas , and Hamas , from the point of view of virtue , legitimacy , and justice , has been recast as Israel . This inversion of legitimacy has been taking place over the last 31 years & nbsp ; since the Oslo Accords , and it is time that we stop defending ourselves intellectually & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; morally .& nbsp ; We must move from intellectual & nbsp ; defense & nbsp ; to offense reflected in an assertive diplomacy .& rdquo ; Diker presented the results of a JCFA poll released at the Jpost conference that showed that 79 % of Israelis opposed the establishment of Palestinian states in Gaza and the West Bank that could threaten Ben Gurion Airport and Israel & rsquo ; s coastal cities . Notably , the poll also showed that 64 % of Israelis rejected a Palestinian state , even if accompanied by Saudi normalization . Diker noted that these findings affirmed the Knesset vote in which an unprecedented 99 MKs opposed US endorsement of a Palestinian state .& nbsp ; The second part of the discussion was led by Yousef , who said that the ideological dimensions of the war cannot be ignored . & ldquo ; Palestine is a device that the Muslims use as a weapon against Israel and as a weapon against the Jewish people . Fundamentally , Muslims think that Allah hates the Jewish people .& rdquo ; Yousef said that it was unacceptable for Muslims to take the side of a terrorist group that committed unforgivable crimes in the name of & ldquo ; resistance & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; occupation .& rdquo ; He voiced his opposition to a two - state solution with a Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority . & ldquo ; For those representing a two - state solution , they either want Israel to cease to exist , or they are not aware of this existential threat ,& rdquo ; he declared . He added that in his opinion , the Palestinian Authority is an even greater threat than Hamas .& nbsp ; Diker announced that the organization is changing its name to the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , reflecting its activities in that sphere . & ldquo ; We see ourselves as the engine for Israel & rsquo ; s foreign affairs , serving as a bridge between the West and the Arab Muslim majority East .& rdquo ; It will lead research - driven strategic and communication initiatives for the security and prosperity of Israel , its & nbsp ; Abraham Accord partners , and prospective allies seeking normalization with Israel .& nbsp ; The Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs sponsored a portion of the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference .& nbsp ; www . jpost . com / AC24
