Simona Steinbrecher had no information about her youngest daughter , Doron , for more than 100 days after Hamas kidnapped her from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on the morning of October 7 . The last message Simona received from Doron was a WhatsApp voice note in which she mentioned that the terrorists had taken her .& ldquo ; Around 10 am , Doron called me and said she heard terrorists and was afraid . She was crying . Then she sent an audio message saying that they got her . It was terrible . Until now , I go to sleep and wake up with her voice in my head ,& rdquo ; Simona said . After 107 days of captivity , on January 26 , Hamas released a video featuring Doron and two other hostages , Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev . The video was edited together , and the women asked the Israeli government to bring them back home .& ldquo ; I was very happy when I saw the video because , until then , we heard nothing about Doron . No one who came back saw her . But with that , I was very afraid and worried because I can see that she is not well . Now I can & rsquo ; t even think about how terrible it is for her to be in Gaza all this time ,& rdquo ; Simona added . According to Simona , Doron has a serious hormonal health issue and needs to have medicine every day .& ldquo ; I can see from how she looks in the video that they didn & rsquo ; t give her the medicine ,& rdquo ; Simona said . The hostages who have returned from Gaza have shared with Simona alarming reports . The situation is dire , with severe shortages of food , water , and a place to sleep . The remaining female hostages there are facing especially brutal treatment by the terrorists . Simona is gravely concerned about the situation and emphasizes the urgent need for global attention to address it .& ldquo ; We heard the stories of the people who came back from Gaza , and they say terrible things ,& rdquo ; she said , adding : & ldquo ; We are very afraid about what is happening there .& rdquo ; Simona relayed the story of returned hostage Amit Soussana , who recounted sexual assault while in captivity , a thought that terrifies Doron & rsquo ; s mother . Amit shared with the world that while in Gaza , she was held alone , chained up in darkness and was forced to commit sexual acts for her Hamas captor .& ldquo ; What else does the world need to know ?& rdquo ; asked Simona . & ldquo ; Why do they say it [ sexual assault ] is not happening there , when the women who are coming back tell us that it happened ? The whole world should cry about it and do everything to stop this !& rdquo ; exclaimed Simona , an incredibly strong and courageous woman whose feelings are beyond description .& ldquo ; That morning , my daughter was in bed in her pajamas , and they took her . What did she do to them ? Why take her ? They took babies , little kids , women , elderly & mdash ; everyone ! For what ?& rdquo ; she asked . Despite experiencing unimaginable emotional pain and horror , Simona continues to fiercely fight for the world to recognize the heinous crimes being committed against hostages and unite to combat terrorism once and for all .& ldquo ; The world needs to know how brutal Hamas is ,& rdquo ; Simona insisted . & ldquo ; They are not people ; they just want to kill . I don & rsquo ; t understand why the world doesn & rsquo ; t scream about what is happening . The world needs to tell them to stop .& rdquo ; Simona believes that the problem in the ongoing conflict is not Israel but rather Hamas & rsquo ; refusal to engage in negotiations and reach an agreement .& ldquo ; Sinwar doesn & rsquo ; t want a deal ,& rdquo ; she said , referring to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar . & ldquo ; When we [ Israel ] are close to the deal , he always has new conditions he wants Israel to do . How can you make a deal with someone who changes his mind all the time ? It is impossible ,& rdquo ; she claimed . Simona & rsquo ; s message is clear and urgent : We must unite as a global community with a singular objective & mdash ; to exert pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and agree to a cease - fire . Only collective efforts can make a difference , according to Simona .& ldquo ; We need Qatar , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the United States and all the other countries to tell Hamas : & lsquo ; now you have to make this deal ,& rsquo ;& rdquo ; Simona pleaded .& ldquo ; I want the world to see the real picture of what happened here ,& rdquo ; she said . Simona strongly believes that there is a frightening connection between terrorism in Israel and the recent attacks happening around the world . She emphasizes that the world needs to recognize this trend and understand that what Israel is going through now is just the tip of the iceberg of a much larger , global problem .& ldquo ; We see the attacks that are happening in France , in England , in the United States , in Russia . People need to think and realize that if we don & rsquo ; t stop them [ terrorists ] now , they will come to your country ,& rdquo ; she explained . Even amid the fear and desperation of not having seen her daughter in six months , Simona & rsquo ; s thoughts extend to the innocent people in Gaza . She believes that defeating Hamas will be the key to providing relief to those who are currently enduring the harsh realities of war , as Hamas is responsible for the fact that people in the region do not have food .& ldquo ; The whole world must stop Hamas also to save innocent people in Gaza . Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t let them take food , and this is the real picture ,& rdquo ; asserted Simona , who continued to share details of some of the crimes committed by Hamas and its leader , Sinwar , towards people in the region . She also asserted that despite receiving aid from other countries and Israel , Hamas hoards food for themselves and prevents civilians from accessing it by resorting to violence and killing Gazans who attempt to take the aid .& ldquo ; People in Gaza don & rsquo ; t have food not because Israel doesn & rsquo ; t give it to them , but because Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t let anyone have it ,& rdquo ; she said .& ldquo ; The world needs to know the truth . Sinwar doesn & rsquo ; t care about his people . If the world wants good for the civilians in Gaza . they must tell Sinwar to make a deal ,& rdquo ; added Simona . Simona Recounts the Horror of Oct . 7 & ldquo ; It began at six and a half in the morning . Hamas came from the air , with the cars , from all the places , and there were hundreds of them in our kibbutz ,& rdquo ; recounted Simona , who described how on the day of the massacre , couples , individuals , and families living in Kfar Aza had to stay in their safe rooms for up to 13 hours , as did many other people in the South .& ldquo ; Think about little kids who needed to be in a safe room for 11 hours , with no water and no food , in the dark . It was terrible for them , and until now , children speak about this ,& rdquo ; said Simona . Recalling what she saw with her own eyes , Simona added : & ldquo ; I saw how they [ Hamas terrorists ] kill people . I remember a house that burned slowly until there wasn & rsquo ; t any more fire , and I knew that a couple was there , and I knew they were burning alive .& rdquo ; According to Simona , Hamas killed 63 people in Kfar Aza alone .& ldquo ; I want everyone who has a daughter , sister , or mother to think about what they would do if their family had to go through the same thing . Everyone who has a grandmother , grandfather , daughter , son , nephew , brother & mdash ; what would you do ?& rdquo ; Simona asked rhetorically . About DoronSimona & rsquo ; s daughter Doron , 31 , is a veterinary nurse .& ldquo ; She likes animals and kids , and she is like a second mother to her little nephew . They love her so much . She didn & rsquo ; t do anything wrong to anyone . She always wants to help everyone ,& rdquo ; Simona said .& ldquo ; Her work is the thing that she likes the most . All the time we had dogs in our house . She brings animals to our house and takes care of them ,& rdquo ; she continued .& ldquo ; I want to hold her . I miss her so much . She is my baby , and I want her to come back ,& rdquo ; added Simona .& ldquo ; We hear all the time that Hamas kills another hostage , and we are afraid ,& rdquo ; admitted Simona .
