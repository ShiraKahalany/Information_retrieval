On the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Yom Kippur War , The Institute For Monitoring Peace And Culture Tolerance In School Education ( IMPACT - se ) reported finding an improving depiction of Israeli - Egyptian relations in school books . IMPACT - se expressed that textbooks , for students up to grade 6 , were portraying the war as more of a pre - cursor to the peace agreement that ended conflict between the two nations . Egyptian textbooks have been analyzed yearly by the organization since 2018 and they plan to continue their investigations until 2030 . Antisemitic attitudes in Egyptian textbooksThe original attitude taken by the textbooks expressed an ideology the portrayed & ldquo ; Jewish treachery ,& rdquo ; IMPACT - se said . Only a year ago , a fifth grade Islamic Education textbook was removed as it compared the Yom Kippur War to the Muslim Prophet Mohammed & rsquo ; s wars against Jews of Arabia . The removed book also used antisemitic stereotypes , assigning evil deeds , disloyalty and fraud to Jewish people collectively . Specifically , the books described & ldquo ; the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal ,& rdquo ; emphasizing that & ldquo ; they are always like this & rdquo ; and asked students to use the internet to search for Qur & rsquo ; anic verses about & ldquo ; the treachery of the Jews ." The textbook also didn & rsquo ; t refer to & lsquo ; Israel & rsquo ;, rather substituted the name for & ldquo ; enemies & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; usurping Jews .& rdquo ; Under the new version of the textbook , lessons celebrate an underlining tolerance and coexistence between Jews and Muslims . IMPACT - se Marcus Sheff commented that & ldquo ; The fiftieth anniversary of the Yom Kippur War gives opportunity to reflect on Israel - Egyptian relations today . While the Israel - Egypt peace agreement & nbsp ; has often been viewed as a & lsquo ; cold & rsquo ; peace , this report shows how Egypt & rsquo ; s textbook reform is increasingly promoting the values of peace , tolerance and respect for Israel . & nbsp ; This offers hope for a warmer , closer peace between the two peoples ."
