Police on Sunday arrested Muna al - Kurd , 23 , a prominent activist from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah , on suspicion of & ldquo ; participating in disturbing the peace and in riots .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Her twin brother , Mohammad , was also arrested on the same charges .

Al - Kurd and her brother were released late Sunday night , hours after they were taken into custody .
& nbsp ;
Over the past few weeks , the two became the voices of the Arab families facing eviction orders from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah . They posted several videos on social - media platforms that documented protests and clashes between Palestinian activists and the police .
& nbsp ;
The Kurd siblings have also appeared in dozens of interviews with various media outlets and organizations around the world to speak about the Sheikh Jarrah dispute .
& nbsp ;
Muna al - Kurd has 1 . 2 million followers on Instagram .
& nbsp ;
She and her brother describe themselves as journalists and are said to be behind the popular social - media hashtag # SaveSheikhJarrah , which has been trending for several weeks .
& nbsp ;
Late last month , Muna al - Kurd delivered a speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council during a session on & ldquo ; the grave human rights situation in the occupied territory , including east Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
Israeli authorities refused to properly examine the property rights of the Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah , she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The police raided our home and handcuffed Muna ,& rdquo ; said her father , Nabil al - Kurd . & ldquo ; The police officers followed her into the room when she went to change her clothes before they took her away . They didn & rsquo ; t even allow her to brush her teeth .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The police officers searched the home of his son , Mohammad , who was not present at the time his sister was taken into custody . The brother later handed himself over to the police .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The police think that the arrests will silence our people and stop the campaign [ against the Sheikh Jarrah evictions ],& rdquo ; Nabil al - Kurd said . & ldquo ; But the people and the shabab [ youth ] of Jerusalem will not be silenced . They will continue to talk about the Palestinian cause and how Israel stole our lands .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Muna al - Kurd was arrested one day after she was seen filming the detention of Al - Jazeera Arabic reporter Givara Budeiri by the police at Sheikh Jarrah . Budeiri was released a few hours later .
& nbsp ;
It was not clear whether Muna al - Kurd & rsquo ; s arrest was connected to the incident involving Budeiri .
& nbsp ;
Several Palestinian activists gathered outside the Shalem police station in east Jerusalem to protest against the arrests of the Kurd siblings . They also chanted slogans in support of al - Aqsa Mosque .
& nbsp ;
The arrests of Muna and Mohammad al - Kurd would not deter the Palestinians from continuing the campaign to resist the planned eviction , said Ahmed Mansour , a friend of the Kurd family .
& nbsp ;
The eviction orders were issued earlier this year by the Jerusalem District Court . At the request of the attorney - general , the Supreme Court last month delayed until further notice a session to look into the case .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Muna and Mohammad are the symbols of the Palestinian struggle in Jerusalem ,& rdquo ; Mansour said , adding that he and his friends would continue to hold daily protests at Sheikh Jarrah & ldquo ; to prevent Jewish settlers from taking our homes .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s ruling Fatah faction and Hamas condemned the arrest of the Kurd siblings and called for their immediate release .
& nbsp ;
The arrests are a & ldquo ; crime that reflects the mentality of ethnic cleansing and apartheid ,& rdquo ; Fatah spokesman Osama Qawassmeh said .
& nbsp ;
The arrests of Muna and her brother & ldquo ; reflect the ugly face of the state of occupation and its breaches of international laws ,& rdquo ; said Abdel Latif al - Qanou , a spokesman for Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
