Richard Gere is starring in an English - language remake of Longing by Israeli director Savi Gabizon , set to hit US theaters on June 7 . Gere has visited Israel several times and starred in the 2016 movie Norman , by Israeli director Joseph Cedar , in which he played a conman who befriended an Israeli prime minister . The movie was filmed in filmed in the US and Israel . The Longing remake is set in the US , however , and is being remade by Gabizon himself – an unusual move , because generally , when Israeli directors sell a film for a remake , a different director is brought in . Longing , which won the BNL Audience Award at the Venice Film Festival , tells the story of a man whose old girlfriend looks him up and is shocked to learn that he fathered a child with her , and that child grew up and then died tragically . Diane Kruger stars opposite Gere as the mother of his child . Gabizon , one of Israel ’ s most popular movie directors , made his first film , Shuroo , in 1991 , which he followed up with the hit Lovesick on Nana Street in 1995 . His next film , Nina ’ s Tragedies , was the first Israeli film to compete in the Best Narrative Feature section at the Sundance Film Festival .
