We weren & rsquo ; t able to control the ball the way we wanted to , but I & rsquo ; m very happy with the win . Sometimes you have to work very hard to win .& ldquo ; This is another game that gives Reineh more and more credit ,& rdquo ; Sharon Mimer said . & ldquo ; I can say that I am very proud of my team and my players , even more than some of the games that we did win .

The dream is still alive and if we still have a chance to win the title we will do our utmost .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; We had a very weak day and we couldn & rsquo ; t control the ball at all ,& rdquo ; Hapoel Haifa coach Roni Levy said . Unfortunately that didn & rsquo ; t help our cause . When we play an open style of game that doesn & rsquo ; t play to our advantage and every loss , especially a derby , is a bitter defeat for us and the fans .& rdquo ; Beitar Jerusalem crushes Hapoel Tel AvivAt Bloomfield Stadium , Beitar Jerusalem crushed Hapoel Tel Aviv 5 - 1 to cruise to the big win and take the three points .

We took a 1 - 0 first half lead and we weren & rsquo ; t that great but we put on quite a performance in the second half . The guys are just champs .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; Really rough feelings ,& rdquo ; Hapoel Tel Aviv head coach Yossi Abukasis said . & ldquo ; To lose such an important game the way we did after the first half & ndash ; which was perhaps one of our best & ndash ; and then fall apart in the second half is very disappointing and painful . We will have to figure out a way to deal with this .& rdquo ; Elsewhere , Hapoel Beersheba got by Bnei Sakhnin 2 - 1 as the Southern Reds came back from a deficit to take the victory . Following a goalless opening half , Basil Khuri scored off a counter attack in the 57th minute , but a Dor Hugi own - goal three minutes later evened up the score .

The guys worked very hard and we are the best home team in the league . We want to play our best and collect as many points as we can over the course of the next month .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; We were leading 1 - 0 and we tried to pressure Beersheba ,& rdquo ; Sakhnin coach Slobodan Drapic said . & ldquo ; Not every club will go and do that . We made mistakes and lost the game . We are trying to get more and more of our young players time to play and from there we will see what we have for next season .& rdquo ; Also , Hapoel Jerusalem downed Hapoel Hadera 2 - 1 thanks to a pair of quick second - half goals to take all the points .

Just two minutes later Dia Lababidi redirected a Cedric Don ball for an own - goal which was the eventual winner for Ziv Arie & rsquo ; s team .& ldquo ; The small changes we made in personnel specifically for Hadera & rsquo ; s system worked out well ,& rdquo ; Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Arie said . However , most important was how the players reacted positively . I thought that once we took the lead we would be able to have a bit more control but we ended up with a couple of injuries .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; After we took the lead , Jerusalem took some chances and I & rsquo ; m disappointed that we couldn & rsquo ; t take advantage of them ,& rdquo ; Hadera coach Haim Silvas said .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; This was a wide open game and I knew they would take some risks in the second half as they went forward , but I felt we would be able to score a second goal with the weapons that we have .& rdquo ; Maccabi Netanya blanked Maccabi Petah Tikva 2 - 0 as the diamond city side scored a goal in each half to take the victory .

We were able to calm down after the State Cup loss which was pretty painful for all of us . But the guys with mentally and physically put on quite the show in terms of the game they played and the result .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; This was not a good game from us in terms of pressure and energy ,& rdquo ; Petah Tikva assistant coach Ben Binyamin said . & ldquo ; We didn & rsquo ; t come into this game properly and we have to see why that was the case . We were weak in the middle and we didn & rsquo ; t do what we needed to do in this game .& rdquo ; Finally , Ashdod SC slipped by Hapoel Petah Tikva 1 - 0 as Ezekiel Henty scored the lone goal of the game at the stroke of halftime to give the port city squad the conquest .
