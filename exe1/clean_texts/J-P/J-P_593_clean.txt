Hamas says it is confident it will score another victory in the upcoming Palestinian parliamentary election , according to sources close to the Islamist movement .
& nbsp ;
The Islamist movement says it also has no intention of accepting the conditions of the Middle East Quartet ( US , UN , Russia and EU ) for the recognition of any Palestinian government , the renunciation of violence , the recognition of Israel & rsquo ; s right to exist and a commitment to abide by all agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel .
& nbsp ;
Hamas & rsquo ; s election program will be similar to the one it used to win the hearts and minds of Palestinians during the 2006 parliamentary election .
& nbsp ;
Then , Hamas candidates ran as part of a list named the & ldquo ; Change and Reform Bloc & rdquo ; under the slogan : & ldquo ; Islam is the solution . One hand builds , another resists . Yes to reform , yes to change .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas believes its chances of scoring another victory , if and when the parliamentary election takes place , are very good , given the growing schism in Fatah and allegations of financial and administrative corruption in Palestinian Authority institutions , the sources said .
& nbsp ;
Hamas is also convinced that many Palestinians will vote for its candidates because they identify with the Islamist movement & rsquo ; s ideology .
& nbsp ;
There were two main reasons why Hamas won the last parliamentary election . Firstly , there were divisions among Fatah , many of whose disgruntled members chose to run as independents . Secondly , there was widespread frustration with rampant corruption of Fatah and PA leaders .
& nbsp ;
Explaining its decision to participate in the 2006 election , the Change and Reform Bloc said in its election program : & ldquo ; The Islamic Resistance Movement [ Hamas ] believes its participation in the legislative elections at this time , and in light of the reality in which the Palestinian cause is witnessing , comes within the framework of its comprehensive program for the liberation of Palestine and the return of the Palestinian people to their land and homeland .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
In 1996 , Hamas boycotted the first parliamentary elections because they were held under the umbrella of the Oslo Accords , which it continues to oppose .
& nbsp ;
In 2006 , however , Hamas changed its mind and decided to participate in the election to the parliament , the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ). The result was a victory for Hamas , which received 44 . 45 % of the vote and won 74 of the 132 seats .
& nbsp ;
Addressing the Palestinian public ahead of that election , the Change and Reform Bloc said it was seeking & ldquo ; to build a developed Palestinian civil society and direct the Palestinian political system and its political and reform program to achieve the national rights of the Palestinian people .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Hamas list emphasized that & ldquo ; historical Palestine is part of the Arab and Islamic lands , and it is a right of the Palestinian people that does not pass by the statute of limitations .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Palestinian people , the list noted , & ldquo ; are still in the stage of national liberation , and they have the right to work to restore their rights and end the occupation by using all means , including armed resistance . Resistance in all its forms is a natural right of the Palestinian people to end the occupation and establish the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Hamas list also promised to make Islamic law & ldquo ; the main source of legislation in Palestine and respect public freedoms .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Palestinian blood is a taboo in Palestinian society , and dialogue is the only acceptable method for resolving internal Palestinian disputes ,& rdquo ; it told voters .
& nbsp ;
Moreover , the Hamas list pledged to halt & ldquo ; political arrests & rdquo ; and vowed to & ldquo ; protect civil - society institutions .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
But in July 2007 , the group staged a violent coup against the PA and seized control of the Gaza Strip . Dozens of Palestinians were killed during the violence .
& nbsp ;
Hamas has since arrested thousands of Palestinians , especially those affiliated with its rivals in Fatah , in addition to journalists , political activists , human - rights advocates and civil - society workers .
& nbsp ;
Hamas & rsquo ; s 2006 election campaign also focused on corruption , an issue that has been bothering many Palestinians since the inception of the PA in 1994 .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Public funds are the right of all the Palestinian people and should be used in financing comprehensive Palestinian development in a manner that achieves justice away from abuse , corruption and embezzlement ,& rdquo ; Hamas said in its election program .
& nbsp ;
It promised to combat corruption & ldquo ; in all its forms and enhance transparency and accountability .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas leaders were scheduled to participate in a meeting of several Palestinian factions in Cairo on Monday to discuss preparations for the parliamentary , presidential and Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) elections .
& nbsp ;
If the factions reach an agreement , the parliamentary election will take place on May 22 , and the presidential election will take place on July 31 . The vote for the PNC , the PLO & rsquo ; s legislative body , has been set for the end of August .
& nbsp ;
Aware that its chances of winning the presidential election are nonexistent , Hamas has its eyes set on the Palestinians & rsquo ; two parliaments : the PLC and the PNC .
& nbsp ;
The PLC & rsquo ; s 132 members represent Palestinians living in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem . The PNC parliament has nearly 700 members and represents all Palestinians , inside and outside those areas .
