Against the background of the protests against the Netanyahu government , which are intensifying as the war continues , on Sunday evening , Brig .- Gen Amir Haskel , one of the leaders of the protests against the government , spoke with Ben Caspit and Prof . Aryeh Eldad on 103FM ." We are starting a strike that will end on Wednesday evening and the intention is to set up a tent city on the street itself , of course with the approval of the police and the municipality ," said Haskel . " Our goal is to create pressure on the politicians , because while we cannot announce elections , in the current situation it may still affect them and how they make decisions ." For me personally , the easiest thing was to be at home today , but I have children and grandchildren and I am here for their future ," Haskel continued . " I am not in favor of burning down the house , but I am in favor of exercising the rights of every person in a democracy . Why are Israelis protesting now ?& ldquo ; The main reason for the protests , at least according to the polls , is that the public has lost faith in the government . I am talking about the decisions concerning the North , the hostages ... the amount of soldiers the IDF has today in the West Bank ... is greater than the number of soldiers in the Gaza Strip . We are almost half a year after October 7 and people have not taken to the streets for a while because of the war , but the very fact that many people are coming to Jerusalem now is a sign that people are fed up ." He continued , " October 7 cannot be ignored . On that day , everything collapsed . Our conceptions about our security , the politics , the economy . It is unlike anything that has happened here in the country since its establishment . According to the polls , 51 % of the public supports going to the elections , and 57 % are sure that the prime minister is not doing everything for the release of the hostages ."
