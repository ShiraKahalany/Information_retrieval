Can the US offer financial assistance to the Palestinians even while the Palestinian Authority pays monthly stipends to terrorists and their families ?
& nbsp ;
The question was raised by reporters and pundits on Wednesday when the US announced it planned to restore humanitarian and security assistance to the Palestinians , as part of an overall financial package of $ 290 million .
& nbsp ;
Former US president Donald Trump cut all funding to the Palestinians , which had soared close to $ 600 million annually under the Obama administration .
& nbsp ;
Trump also put in place legislation to hold the PA financially accountable for terror activity and to halt its practice of terror stipends , known as & ldquo ; pay - for - slay .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
A reporter referenced that legislation when quizzing US State Department spokesman Ned Price on how the Biden administration could legally restore funding .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; US laws & ndash ; there & rsquo ; s several of them & ndash ; say that the US cannot provide money to the Palestinian Authority ,& rdquo ; the reporter stated .
& nbsp ;
Price assured him that the funding was & ldquo ; absolutely consistent with relevant US law .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Here are five things to know about US funding to Palestinians and PA terror payments :
& nbsp ;
PA & rsquo ; s pay - for - slay
The Palestinian Authority provides monthly stipends to the families of terrorists who are killed while engaging in acts of terrorism , and to those jailed for terrorist acts or on suspicion of terrorist activity .
& nbsp ;
It is estimated that the PA spends at least NIS 500 million annually on these stipends , with higher payments going to those whose crimes were more severe and who have longer jail sentences .
& nbsp ;
Proponents of & ldquo ; pay - for - slay & rdquo ; brand the payments as a kind of social welfare system , particularly in light of Israel & rsquo ; s practice of administrative detentions in which security prisoners can be held without charges .& nbsp ;
Opponents have argued that if this were the case , payments would be based on need rather than the severity of the crime .
& nbsp ;
Taylor Force Act
US military veteran Taylor Force was stabbed to death in March 2016 , while in Israel for a business program , near the beach in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian . Two years later the US Congress passed legislation prohibiting direct assistance to the PA , to prevent terror payments based on US funds going to anyone associated with Force & rsquo ; s death .
& nbsp ;
The Biden administration intends to uphold that legislation , including not paying PA loans .
& nbsp ;
The Anti - Terror Clarification Act
The anti - terror clarification act of 2018 allowed the Palestinian Authority to be financially liable should it be found guilty in US courts of supporting terror activity . The legislation was broadly written so that even humanitarian assistance to non - governmental Palestinian organizations , peace - building funding or scholarship funding puts the PA in a position of liability .
& nbsp ;
The PA notified the US in 2019 that it would not accept any funding , including humanitarian assistance , over fear of judicial liability . Subsequent Congressional legislation amended the ATCA to allow financial assistance to the Palestinian people , but leaving intact judicial liability issues for direct funding to the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization .
& nbsp ;
PA Security Forces
The US - trained Palestinian security forces , which cooperate with the IDF , are considered an essential pillar of stability in the West Bank . Funding for those forces , which had amounted to $ 60 million annually , was exempt under the Taylor Force Act .
& nbsp ;
Joel Braunold , managing director of the S . Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace , said that the Taylor Force Act was specifically intended to target the Economic Support Funds account that drew on & ldquo ; bilateral economic assistance and humanitarian traditional programs in the West Bank and Gaza .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
But it was not intended to & ldquo ; affect security assistance that comes from the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement account ( INLE ), not covered by Taylor Force requirements .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Funding for the security forces , however , was impacted by the ATCT , a problem corrected by amendments to that legislation . The Biden administration has now resumed funding to the PA security forces .
& nbsp ;
UNRWA
The majority of US funding to the Palestinians had always gone through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees , amounting to an annual grant of over $ 350 million . The US was the single largest donor to UNRWA .
& nbsp ;
The Trump administration & rsquo ; s decision in 2018 to cut funding to UNRWA was not based on prohibitions in the ATCT or the Taylor Force Act . There was no legal impediment to continued US funding to UNRWA , which services 5 . 7 million Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem , Gaza , the West Bank , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria .
& nbsp ;
The Trump administration made a policy decision not to support the organization because it believed that Palestinians could be better served by other organizations . It agreed with Israel that UNRWA & rsquo ; s definition of who is a Palestinian refugee was problematic , and that the organization was inefficient and promoted incitement against Israel .
& nbsp ;
The Biden administration has now made a policy decision to support UNRWA , with an initial grant of $ 150 million .
