The Palestinian Authority condemned Israel & rsquo ; s decision to advance plans for building 2 , 223 Jewish homes in Area C of the West Bank , and said the move contradicts the Biden administration & rsquo ; s declared policy of opposing settlement construction and unilateral measures .

The Civil Administration is expected to advance plans next week for building the new homes in Area C , which is exclusively controlled by Israel .

On Wednesday , Defense Minister Benny Gantz also agreed to & nbsp ; expand the Palestinian foothold in Area C & nbsp ; by authorizing the construction of 863 housing units in Palestinian villages in the area .

The Civil Administration rarely grants building permits to Palestinians in Area C .

The PA warned on Thursday against the new settlement projects , dubbing them & ldquo ; a clear violation of the Oslo Agreement , which explicitly states that no unilateral measures should be taken by any party .& rdquo ;

The PA said that the decision to build new homes for Jews is & ldquo ; a violation of all international legitimacy resolutions , foremost of which is UN Security Council Resolution 2334 .& rdquo ;

Adopted in 2016 , the resolution expressed & ldquo ; grave concern that continuing Israeli settlement activities are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two - state solution based on the 1967 lines .& rdquo ; It also called for a freeze of all settlement activity , including & ldquo ; natural growth ,& rdquo ; and the dismantlement of all settlement outposts erected since March 2001 .

& ldquo ; This rejected Israeli decision contradicts the clear American position expressed by President Joe Biden during his call with President Mahmoud Abbas , in which he affirmed the American side & rsquo ; s rejection of settlements and unilateral measures ,& rdquo ; the PA said in a statement .

It called on the Biden administration and the international community & ldquo ; to work seriously and immediately & rdquo ; to stop Israel from proceeding with its plans , and warned that the decision will lead to increased tensions and instability .

& ldquo ; These Israeli measures will not contribute to the American efforts to enhance confidence - building measures between the two parties ,& rdquo ; according to the PA . & ldquo ; Real peace and security are linked to the extent of commitment to all international agreements and legitimacy .& rdquo ;

Azzam al - Ahmed , a senior member of the Fatah Central Committee , said that the Israeli decision shows that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett & ldquo ; is not better & rdquo ; than his predecessor , Benjamin Netanyahu .

& ldquo ; The settlement policy has not changed at all , and the current Israeli government is not better than the previous one ,& rdquo ; Ahmed told the PA & rsquo ; s Voice of Palestine radio station . & ldquo ; Bennett is even worse .& rdquo ;

The PA Foreign Ministry also condemned the plan to build new settler homes as & ldquo ; theft of Palestinian land .& rdquo ;

The plan , if approved , & ldquo ; means the confiscation and theft of more Palestinian land and the dismemberment of the West Bank ,& rdquo ; the ministry said in a statement . & ldquo ; This is an attempt to whitewash and legitimize settlements and beautify Israel & rsquo ; s colonial settlement decisions while misleading the international community and world public opinion .& rdquo ;

The ministry pointed out that the decision to authorize the Palestinian homes was not an Israeli & ldquo ; favor & rdquo ; because these houses were already previously built and inhabited by their Palestinian owners , or are under construction on Palestinian land owned by their owners .

& ldquo ; The ministry views with great gravity the decision to build new settlement units and considers it a blatant aggression against the Palestinian people and their homeland , and a painful blow to the international and American efforts to revive the peace process ,& rdquo ; the statement read . & ldquo ; It is also a systematic undermining of the chances of achieving the principle of the two - state solution and a disregard for international legitimacy and its decisions , foremost of which is Security Council Resolution 2334 .& rdquo ;

The PA ministry accused Israel of ignoring the positions of countries that demand a halt to unilateral measures and are working to help the Palestinians and Israelis in order to create an appropriate environment for reviving the peace process .

The ruling Fatah faction denounced the decision as a & ldquo ; war crime & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; aggression & rdquo ; against the Palestinians .

& ldquo ; Israel & rsquo ; s attempts to legitimize colonial settlement in return for & lsquo ; positive & rsquo ; steps is completely rejected ,& rdquo ; said Fatah spokesperson Osama Qawasmeh . & ldquo ; It is time to put an end to the destructive Israeli occupation practices , especially stealing Palestinian land and building settlements in violation of international legitimacy .& rdquo ;
