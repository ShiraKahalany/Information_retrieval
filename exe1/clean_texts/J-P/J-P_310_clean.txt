Over 50 , 000 Israelis have visited the United Arab Emirates since the recent normalization pact between Israel and the UAE , according to a report this week in The Washington Post .
That number is the result of only two weeks of open commercial flights between the countries , which agreed to open the diplomatic and tourism floodgates in a historic agreement signed in August . Tens of thousands more were expected to visit during the Hanukkah holiday , according to the Post .
The report also said that the Jewish community center in Dubai , the UAE capital , is increasing its staff from five to & ldquo ; about 30 & rdquo ; employees , and that nearly 150 restaurants have begun serving kosher food . The center is planning to build a mikvah & ldquo ; befitting Dubai & rsquo ; s luxury standards .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; It will probably be the nicest mikvah in the world ,& rdquo ; said Rabbi Mendel Duchman , who works for the JCC .
Israel & rsquo ; s normalization agreement with the UAE , which preceded others signed with Bahrain , Sudan and Morocco , was a watershed moment for the Jewish state & rsquo ; s relationship with the Arab world . Until August , Israel only had formal relations with two Arab countries , Egypt and Jordan .
