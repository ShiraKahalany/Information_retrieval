In a surprise move , on May 24 , 2000 , the IDF unilaterally pulled back from southern Lebanon to the international border , known as the Blue Line , in compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 425 . A few weeks later , former - UN secretary - general Kofi Annan officially confirmed that the withdrawal met the Security Council @@@ s demands . That approval happened 21 years ago today .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Resolution 425 & quot ; called upon Israel to cease its military action against Lebanese territorial integrity and withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebanese territory ,& quot ; according to the UN .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
It also established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) with the purpose of & quot ; confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces , restoring international peace and security , and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuing the return of its effective authority in the area .& quot ;& nbsp ;

The resolution had originally been drafted in 1978 , but it had only been implemented 22 years later .& nbsp ;

The resolution @@@ s initial intention was to stop the cycle of bloody violence between the PLO and the IDF in northern Israel and southern Lebanon , which began in March 1978 .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
However , the First Lebanon War broke out four years later in 1982 , and Israel remained entrenched in southern Lebanon for the following 18 years . 

Hundreds of Israeli soldiers died during this period in terrorist attacks and accidental military catastrophes , as well as in standard on - the - ground operations . Intense public and international pressure finally led to then - prime minister Ehud Barak @@@ s decision to pull back .
& nbsp ;
The 2000 withdrawal finally enabled the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 , much later than any of its members envisioned .& nbsp ;
