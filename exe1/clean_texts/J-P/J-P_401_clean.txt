The images coming from Israel of a massive fire south of Ashkelon , a bus blown up , fires near a gas station and also interceptions near the airport are a message to the region .
& nbsp ;
They appear to show an Israel that is more vulnerable than at any time in recent memory . One might have to reach back to 2009 or 2006 for this sense , but even then it was regional . This has serious ramifications because Iran and Hezbollah may think that Israel is weaker than it is .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Images are important . The images of Israeli police in al - Aqsa Mosque helped to create an excuse for violence . There have been clashes in Haifa , Lod , Ramle , Acre , Nazareth and other cities in Israel . There have been clashes in the South in Bedouin communities and attacks on a synagogue . People have been injured and several shot . This is a reminder of the era of the riots that set off the Second Intifada , which also swept Israel . It is a reminder of vulnerability .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
For the media that are pro - Iran , the narrative is clear . Al - Mayadeen celebrates that Israel was & ldquo ; astonished & rdquo ; by the huge volume of rocket fire . Pro - Iran commentators say Israel has a failed leadership . Tehran & rsquo ; s leadership is saying Israel understands only force and that & ldquo ; resistance is the sole way & rdquo ; to confront the Jewish state .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Images showing celebrations in Jerusalem and in Umm el - Fahm by Arab demonstrators are also being broadcast in the region .
& nbsp ;
This has implications that are broader than whether Hamas has achieved much with firing more than 700 rockets . It may be that the actual damage is not so large in comparison to what it could have been . However , the overall story is about images and narratives .
& nbsp ;
The narrative in Israel is to cast doubt on the leadership , question whether the prime minister has empowered Hamas and whether Iron Dome is able to stop enough rockets . These questions lead to what might happen in a conflict with Hezbollah .
& nbsp ;
The hesitancy of the government to strike back at Gaza also enables the focus to remain on the destruction wrought between Tel Aviv and Ashkelon .
