Iran & rsquo ; s clerical regime on Monday temporarily released an Iranian Jewish woman who was arrested for her alleged visit to Israel .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Farahnaz Kohan , an Iranian Jewish woman was released from Evin prison . The 50 - year - old woman was detained for undisclosed period , due to alleged & nbsp ; travel to Israel --- a crime in the & nbsp ; Islamic Republic of Iran ,& rdquo ; the Alliance for Rights of All Minorities first reported in English .
& nbsp ;
Marjan Keypour Greenblatt , the founder of ARAM , told The Jerusalem Post : & quot ; Once again the Iranian regime is reminding the international community of its arbitrary and illogical @@@ justice @@@ system that exercises cruelty and injustice on a daily basis . There & rsquo ; s a deluge of daily arrests , executions and accounts of torture that we can & rsquo ; t afford to ignore .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
& quot ; For the sake of those lives , rather than turning a blind eye in the name of non - intervention , US and EU officials must hold the Iranian government accountable for their human rights violations and cruel treatment of fellow citizens ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
ARAM Iran promotes equal rights for women , religious and ethnic minorities as well LGBT groups in Iran .
& nbsp ;
The Persian language website HRA News first disclosed the release of Kohan . The article noted that the Iranian & rsquo ; s regime determines that any Iranian who travels to Israel can be sentenced up to five years in prison and can be deprived of a passport .
& nbsp ;
The regime is classified by the US State Department and its officials as the leading state - sponsor of terrorism , Holocaust denial and antisemitism .
& nbsp ;
The Jerusalem Post reported in December that the Islamic Republic of Iran freed imprisoned Iranian Jew Mashallah Pesar Kohan , who was detained in 2017 for visiting his family members in Israel .
& nbsp ;
It is unclear if Mashallah Pesar Kohan is related to Farahnaz Kohan .
