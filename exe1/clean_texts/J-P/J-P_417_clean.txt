Winner of the prestigious Rechter Prize for Young Architects , Daniel Zarhy ( 43 ) hails from a prestigious lineage of architects .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; I am , in fact , the fourth generation in my family to pursue architecture ,& rdquo ; he shared in an interview with The Jerusalem Post , shortly after clinching the esteemed Rechter Prize for young architects . Zarhy won the prize for designing the Faculty of Engineering at the Tel Aviv University . The judges & rsquo ; reasoning stated that & ldquo ; The project harnesses innovative engineering thinking , brilliantly intertwining technological and ecological perspectives , and fostering a genuinely distinctive architectural outcome . By creatively reinterpreting the modernist context of the campus structures in a contemporary light , Zarhy & rsquo ; s project reflects current global trends . The exceptional level of design and execution showcased by the project stands out prominently , deserving commendation within the Israeli context .& rdquo ; Zarhy explained with pride , & ldquo ; My great - grandfather was Ze & rsquo ; ev Rechter . He met my grandfather , Moshe Zarhy , when they studied together at the Technion . Moshe married Rechter & rsquo ; s sister , and they established a firm that later split and was continued by my father .& rdquo ; Zarhy graduated with honors from Tel Aviv University & rsquo ; s School of Architecture . In 2012 , after working for renowned offices such as OMA & ndash ; Rem Koolhaas in Rotterdam and Herzog & amp ; De Meuron in Basel , he founded Studio PEZ together with Pedro Pe & ntilde ; a . The studio has won numerous international competitions , among them : The Jerusalem Courthouse , Ideas competition for a New Opera House in Busan , S . Korea , Broadcom & rsquo ; s R & amp ; D Center at Tel Aviv University , and most recently the campus for Bern & rsquo ; s University of Applied Science ( in collaboration with Wulf Architetken ). Zarhy said that working abroad has influenced his work tremendously .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; I am influenced both by my family & rsquo ; s heritage & ndash ; I practically had architecture streaming in my veins since childhood & ndash ; and my work experiance , which gave me new and different perspectives . When you work in a big international firm with people who hail from around the globe , and everyone brings their point of view , it opens your mind , you get new ideas .& rdquo ; Zarhy and Pe & ntilde ; a established STUDIOPEZ International Architecture Studio in 2012 & ndash ; now based in Basel , Switzerland , and Tel - Aviv & ndash ; as a continuation of their ongoing collaboration while working at Herzog & amp ; De Meuron .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; We started off working together in our spare time on two projects and won both . We thought this was it & ndash ; we made it . But the reality was different , both projects never got completed but our partnership survived and flourished ,& rdquo ; Zarhy said . Duo begin journeyObserving the world & rsquo ; s rapid pace outstripping architecture & rsquo ; s ability to keep up , the duo began their venture by plunging into the depths . They successfully took on complex , large - scale projects and paved their way to solving major architectural challenges . Prioritizing simplicity over complexity , their goal in each project is to craft adaptable and people - centered spaces , fostering long - term benefits for communities and cities .& nbsp ; Since its establishment , PEZ has been able to showcase this philosophy in a significant number of successful projects and competition awards . The building for which Zarhy received the prize houses both R & amp ; D Center for a worldwide leading semiconductor company and the Tel Aviv University Engineering Faculty .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; The building combines the engineering faculty with the semi - conductors & rsquo ; research . Excluding the University Gallery , which was built 35 years ago , this is the first building on campus that was built with the idea of opening to the city .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; This is part of the changed attitude of the university . The campus perimeter , which for years was made up almost exclusively of car parking , will change to be made of buildings that will be open to the urban surroundings as well as the campus ,& rdquo ; Zarhy explained . Challenging the enclosed campus paradigm of the university , the building connects the city and the campus creating a meeting point for academia and industry .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; This is the first building in many years that rises from this level and connects the street outside the campus , to the university campus itself ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; You can enter the building , and the University & rsquo ; s campus from the street that encircles the university , while on the other side of the ground floor - the street floor visually continues , forming a patio , or an enclosed four - meter deep shaded courtyard which is open to the cafeteria .& ldquo ; It is a new model of a research building & ndash ; simple and efficient on one hand , and iconic on the other ,& rdquo ; Zarhy said . This building is , at the same time , both iconic by its merit , and simple by design . When looking for simplicity you sometimes come across the best ideas , new ideas ,& rdquo ; said Zarhy proudly , stressing that his architectural vision is & ldquo ; to make a statement but to keep it simple & rdquo ;.& ldquo ; Winning this prize was extremely important for us ,& rdquo ; Zarhy concluded .
