The world needs to understand the only thing standing between the Gazan people and a ceasefire is Hamas , Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday morning from the G7 summit in Capri , Italy .& nbsp ; Hamas rejected generous proposals from Israel and seems more interested in a regional conflict than a ceasefire that would immediately improve the lives of the Palestinian people , Blinken said .& nbsp ; Hamas continues to reject Israeli ceasefire propositions & nbsp ; Hamas continues to " move the goal post ," Blinken added .& nbsp ; Blinken said the US is in constant engagement with Israel , allies and partners throughout the region and world , calling it a collective effort to bring the conflict in Gaza to a close and to achieve a ceasefire in the release of hostages .& nbsp ;" A number of other countries around the table today also have hostages in Gaza held by Hamas and other groups ," Blinken said . " And it ' s also important to remember , because I sometimes think that people have forgotten this , we have American hostages who ' ve been held in the most deplorable conditions all of this time ."& nbsp ;
