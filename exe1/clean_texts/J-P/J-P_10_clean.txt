" It ' s like snitching to the IRS , and I would never do that ," said Likud party and Knesset member Hanoch Milwidsky on Monday concerning leaks from the party ' s faction meetings . During an interview with the Knesset Channel , Milwidsky addressed internal criticism against the government on the management of the Israel - Hamas war . " There is no one else I would want to lead the country during this time ." זה כמו להלשין למס הכנסה " - ח " כ חנוך מילביצקי על חברי כנסת שמדליפים מהדיונים " אני כחבר כנסת לעולם לא אדווח על מישהו שמעלים הכנסות "@ hanochmilwidsky @ moran_azulay pic . twitter . com / 4Quqzmj1DC & mdash ; ערוץ כנסת (@ KnessetT ) May 27 , 2024I thank God every morning that he is there and not someone else ," said Milwidsky . " The right place to voice criticism concerning the faction is within the faction , Snitching to the IRS & ldquo ; The fact that there are Knesset members and ministers who leak from the discussions is a very specific kind of meanness and baseness . It ' s like snitching to the IRS , and I would never do that , and I completely despise people who do . People can have criticism , that ' s good ." Even when some of the participants in the studio pointed out to MK Milwidsky that tax evasion is against the law , he repeatedly stood by his position . " I will never go and report someone who evades taxes ; I don ' t think citizens should do that ," he said ." A snitch is a very specific type of person , acting against the law . But it ' s not my role to say , ' Look ,' I won ' t be the kind of person who snitches , and I will never carry a microphone or record from faction meetings that aren ' t supposed to be like that ." The following day , Milwidsky posted on X , formerly Twitter , " May there be no hope for informers , and may all heretics be lost in an instant . May all the enemies of your people be quickly cut off . May You swiftly uproot , crush , cast down , and humble the wanton sinners , quickly in our days . Blessed are You , Lord , who breaks enemies and humbles the wanton sinners ," and called the post " Prayer 18 ." ו ְ ל ַ מ ַּ ל ְ ש ִׁ ינ ִ ים א ַ ל ת ְּ ה ִ י ת ִ ק ְ ו ָ ה . ו ְ כ ָ ל ה ַ מ ִּ ינ ִ ים כ ְּ ר ֶ ג ַ ע יאב ֵ דו ּ. ו ְ כ ָ ל אוי ְ ב ֵ י ע ַ מ ְּ ך ָ מ ְ ה ֵ ר ָ ה י ִ כ ָּ ר ֵ תו ּ. ו ְ ה ַ ז ֵ ד ִ ים מ ְ ה ֵ ר ָ ה ת ְ ע ַ ק ֵּ ר ו ּ ת ְ ש ַׁ ב ֵּ ר ו ּ ת ְ מ ַ ג ֵּ ר ו ּ ת ְ כ ַ ל ֵּ ם ו ְ ת ַ ש ְׁ פ ִּ יל ֵ ם ו ְ ת ַ כ ְ נ ִ יע ֵ ם ב ִּ מ ְ ה ֵ ר ָ ה ב ְ י ָ מ ֵ ינו ּ: ב ָּ רו ּ ך ְ א ַ ת ָּ ה ה '. ש ׁ וב ֵ ר אוי ְ ב ִ ים ו ּ מ ַ כ ְ נ ִ יע ַ& hellip ;& mdash ; חנוך מילביצקי - Hanoch Milwidsky (@ hanochmilwidsky ) May 28 , 2024
