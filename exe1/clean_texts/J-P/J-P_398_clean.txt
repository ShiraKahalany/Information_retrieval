A month after Operation Guardian of the Walls , the IDF continues to struggle to maintain calm in the West Bank . With Israel & rsquo ; s attention focused on the Gaza Strip , the flames of violence in the West Bank are at risk of exploding .
& nbsp ;
According to data released by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ), there were 592 attacks in the West Bank and another 178 in Jerusalem in the month of May , compared to a total of 104 in April ( 80 in the West Bank and 24 in Jerusalem ). The May attacks included 401 firebombings , 33 pipe bombs , 87 arson attacks , 47 small - arms fire , two grenade attacks , one vehicular attack and others .
& nbsp ;
One Israeli civilian , Yehuda Guetta , was also killed in a shooting attack at the Tapuah junction in early May by 44 - year - old Muntasir Shalabi .
& nbsp ;
Most of the attacks that took place were not carried out by groups but by lone wolves . Those kinds of attacks , the IDF has admitted , are much more challenging to thwart than attacks planned by groups . If you don & rsquo ; t have an organization , you don & rsquo ; t have the signature of the preparation of the specific attack .
& nbsp ;
Despite the challenges , the great majority of attacks have been thwarted by security forces . But the high number of thwarted attacks also indicate that the flames of violence are growing in the West Bank .
& nbsp ;
While there have been significantly fewer vehicular attacks as well as stabbings and shooting attacks against IDF soldiers , they remain a major threat , especially toward drivers on the roads shared by both Palestinians and Israelis .
& nbsp ;
According to the IDF , shooting or vehicular ramming attacks are more likely to be carried out by young men , and children are behind many cases of stone throwing .
& nbsp ;
Along with the high number of attacks against Israeli targets , a report by Ynet news found that 34 Palestinians were killed over the past month , & ldquo ; more than during any month in the past 10 years .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Comparing the past month to the height of the wave of knife and vehicular - ramming attacks that took place in 2015 - 2016 , an average of 26 Palestinians were killed every month .
& nbsp ;
SO WHAT & rsquo ; S happening ?
& nbsp ;
With the cancellation of the May Palestinian elections in late April , the public has lost all faith in their leaders who they say have abandoned the cause a long time ago . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , they say , has remained silent about the beating of protesters and worshipers by Israel .
& nbsp ;
The reestablishment of the illegal settlement of Evyatar has led to repeated violent clashes between Israeli security forces and local Palestinians . Four Palestinian teenagers have been killed in recent weeks .
& nbsp ;
Like on the Gaza border , Palestinian youths have been taking part in night disturbances with loud riots and setting fires to tires . In one video uploaded to YouTube , demonstrators chant & ldquo ; Greeting from the steadfast village of Beita to the steadfast cities in Gaza .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Evyatar was reestablished by settlers in April on land that historically belonged to the Palestinian villages of Beita , Kabalan and Yatma . Residents have been barred from the land for decades by the Israeli military for security reasons .
& nbsp ;
The IDF has made it clear that the outpost will be demolished , with the IDF & rsquo ; s Central Command writing that & ldquo ; the Evyatar outpost was established illegally , and everything was done in complete violation of the law .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
But , even when it will be demolished , locals aren & rsquo ; t holding their breath . They know that another illegal settlement will likely be built on another hill .
& nbsp ;
And while the fighting between Israel and the terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip ended , the initial reasons behind Hamas & rsquo ; s rocket fire remains : clashes on the Temple Mount . Last week nine Palestinians were wounded by sponge - tipped bullets and stun grenades used by Israeli police when they clashed at the holy site .
& nbsp ;
While rockets are not raining down on Israel , incendiary balloons have caused dozens of fires to rage across southern Israel .
& nbsp ;
Hamas has repeatedly warned that it would once again fire rockets into Israel and restart hostilities over developments in Jerusalem . Terrorist groups on Tuesday warned that if Israel does not allow humanitarian relief into the blockaded enclave , they will once again resort to violence .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We warn the Israeli enemy and its allies of delaying the lifting of the siege . The enemy will not succeed with its extortion policy , and we will not sit back as our people are pushed over ,& rdquo ; the groups said in a statement quoted by Israeli media .
& nbsp ;
Hamas leader Yayha Sinwar , who met with Tor Wennesland , the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process , said Monday that the talks failed , and accused Israel of extortion , urging Palestinians to resist .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It was a bad meeting ,& rdquo ; Sinwar said . It was not positive at all , and we clarified to the [ United Nations ] delegation that we would hold a meeting of Islamic and national factions in Gaza to decide our next steps .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
So while the world watches as southern Israel burns from balloons launched from Gaza , the flames are growing just as deadly in the West Bank . Israel needs to get both fires under control before it & rsquo ; s too late .
