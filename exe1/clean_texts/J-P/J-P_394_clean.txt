Berlin Blues , an excellent series that recently became available on Yes , is about an Israeli couple , a musician and a writer , who move with their daughter to Berlin . It examines the drama caused by their being foreigners in a place that offers a stimulating artistic environment but is shadowed by the tragic history of the Holocaust . It also shows , very convincingly and sympathetically , how dormant problems in a couple & rsquo ; s relationship can be stirred up by such a move . It was created by real - life married couple Itamar Rotschild , a musician , and Dana Idisis , the writer of such series and movies as On the Spectrum and Here We Are , who moved to Berlin with their daughter a couple of years ago . They stayed for about a year , then returned to Israel . & nbsp ; Rotschild himself plays Yonah , the musician husband in the series . Shira Naor portrays Talya , his wife , a woman who has published a novel based on the story of her mentally ill brother , and Idisis has a brother on the autism spectrum , who was part of the inspiration for some of her recent work .& nbsp ; Given all these similarities , Rotschild , speaking from his backyard in a recent interview , wasn & rsquo ; t exactly surprised when I asked how closely the series was based on their actual life . & nbsp ; To what extent is the TV series based on real life ?& ldquo ; Let & rsquo ; s talk about the similarities . We moved to Berlin because I wanted the experience of living abroad for a few years . For Dana , it was after the first season of On the Spectrum and we flew there and lived there for a year and a half , with our daughter . We have two daughters now but then we had only one . For me it was nice there , I found myself there , I felt good .& rdquo ; So many young Israeli couples spend at least a couple of years abroad that it & rsquo ; s practically a rite of passage , but there haven & rsquo ; t been many fictional portrayals of this phenomenon . Berlin , with its low cost of living and thriving arts scene , has become a destination for thousands of young Israelis . Rotschild and Idisis thought of that when they lived there , although Rotschild emphasized that despite the superficial parallels , it was not their story .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; We knew the feeling of being in Berlin and feeling foreign , but we created the stories ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; It can be complicated in so many ways to live in a foreign country . There are lots of little things that you know how they are done at home , but in this new place , everything is different , and you have a feeling of being an outsider .& rdquo ; That feeling puts Yonah and Talya & rsquo ; s marriage under a strain : & ldquo ; There were all kinds of problems before in their marriage , but they were kind of hidden , but here , in Berlin , everything is amplified . You are still you , but the new setting brings out things that were more under control before .& rdquo ; When Talya returns to Israel for a single episode , she is confronted by tough realities of the life she left behind there , notably that there are frequent missile attacks from Gaza during her visit & ndash ; a disclaimer notes that the episode was filmed before October 7 & ndash ; and that her brother and her parents are in denial about the severity of his mental illness .& nbsp ; In a particularly harrowing scene , he insists on returning to work at his job at the Ramat Gan Safari after he has been fired , and when Talya tries to take him home , he jumps out of the car near several hippopotamuses .& ldquo ; You see that so much is hard for her in Israel , too , how complicated it is for her there .& rdquo ; THE RELATIONSHIP of Israelis to Germany is also complicated in all kinds of ways and Berlin Blues deals with that head - on . When Yonah & rsquo ; s mother ( Liora Rivlin ) comes for a visit , she can barely contain her anger at her son for choosing to live in the country that persecuted her parents .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; Lots of people are & lsquo ; anti [ German ],& rsquo ; because of their parents , people don & rsquo ; t want to buy German goods , wouldn & rsquo ; t want to buy a German car . I even know people my from my generation who won & rsquo ; t go to Germany ... Yonah & rsquo ; s mother has a real issue that is connected to the trauma of what so many Jews went through there , and I think that we tried to show what & rsquo ; s behind it , and she isn & rsquo ; t just & lsquo ; anti ,& rsquo ; but you see at the end , with her monologue in German , that she has a real connection to the country because of her parents , she isn & rsquo ; t just & lsquo ; anti .& rsquo ;& rdquo ; Another way that the series differs from his own life , Rotschild said , is that , & ldquo ; My music and the music in the series are two different things .& rdquo ; Rotschild is a guitarist and pianist who writes and performs in a folk - rock style . He has released a number of albums and is at work now on a new one , while Yonah is an oboist who gets a position with a Berlin orchestra .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; I was never in an orchestra . We thought about what would keep Yonah in Berlin , so that it makes the conflict between him and Talya , who wants to go home , stronger , and we thought of having him be an oboe player . The oboe is an instrument that maybe one or two people in orchestras can play full - time in Israel , but it & rsquo ; s hard to make a living at it here . But in Europe , you can make a living at it , there are a lot of orchestras there .& rdquo ; Rotschild had never played the oboe and learned enough to look convincing handling the instrument on screen . & ldquo ; I had a very good teacher , Shani Shachar , and she taught me how to play it and hold it and how to blow in it and how to clean it and how to get a sound from it . It & rsquo ; s a very difficult instrument just to get a sound out of & ndash ; and I & rsquo ; m not talking about a beautiful sound , just any sound at all .& ldquo ; We did a lot of research to get into the world of classical musicians , to check how it sounds , how it feels , what it & rsquo ; s like , because it wasn & rsquo ; t a world we knew . It & rsquo ; s music that I like , but it isn & rsquo ; t music , or a world , that I really know .& rdquo ; Rotschild said that the director of the series , Ram Nehari , who worked with them for two years , & ldquo ; helped to make the series what is today , he directed it beautifully and also worked on the scripts . He had a big influence on how well it turned out .& rdquo ; Rotschild & rsquo ; s most important role prior to Berlin Blues was also as a musician , in the series , The Echo of Your Voice . Rotschild played a struggling artist who is the son of an Arik Einstein - like , all - time great performer , just as the Rotschild character & rsquo ; s own son becomes a rising star . In an unusual achievement , the three lead actors , Rotschild , Shaul Luria , and Orr Amrami Brockman , shared the award for Best Actor at the prestigious Series Mania competition in France .& nbsp ; But when asked whether he intends to continue acting , Rotschild said , & ldquo ; Acting is fun for me . It & rsquo ; s a kind of vacation , like taking a vacation from myself .& rdquo ; Despite his success as an actor , he said , & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not my profession . It seems to me that people who are professional actors have to take parts that are not what they really like , that are not that good , because that & rsquo ; s what they do .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m not there . I only do things I like . So if someone brings me a part that I can connect to , I & rsquo ; ll do it gladly , it & rsquo ; s fun when you feel that you can express yourself through it . But I & rsquo ; m not an actor . I & rsquo ; m a musician who sometimes acts . & ldquo ;
