The Settlements and National Missions Minister , Orit Strock , criticized the Israeli government over what she claimed was a war being thrown into the garbage for the rescue of a mere few hostages in the framework of a hostage exchange agreement with Hamas , in an interview with Army Radio on Wednesday . Strock said that the government was & ldquo ; throwing the [ war effort ] into the trash to save 22 or 33 & rdquo ; of the 133 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza . Insisting that her party & ldquo ; very much & rdquo ; wanted to bring the hostages home , Strock stressed that a deal like the one currently reportedly on the table would leave the vast majority of the hostages still in Gaza alone and abandoned .& ldquo ; The government went to war with a clear decision about the goals of the war ,& rdquo ; she said , adding that & ldquo ; these goals , which were in writing , included the dismantling and destruction of all of Hamas & rsquo ; s abilities in Gaza & ndash ; all of its military , governmental , and economic capabilities .& rdquo ; This , she continued , would lead to & ldquo ; the creation of circumstances in which the hostages could be freed , and the removal of any threat from Gaza against Israel in the long term .& rdquo ; According to Strock , the current negotiation regarding the hostages & rsquo ; release & ldquo ; turns its back on all three of these goals , including the creation of circumstances to bring the hostages home .& rdquo ; Strock expressed concerns that the deal would result in large numbers of Gazans returning to northern Gaza . Further , the agreement would prevent Israel from being able to restart the war effort after a ceasefire is in place . She added that after a deal like the one being discussed , the only & ldquo ; price & rdquo ; a future deal could include would be the overall end of the war .& ldquo ; You essentially are saying , & lsquo ; I & rsquo ; ll be satisfied with 20 - 33 hostages [ being released ].& rsquo ; This is a reckless deal ... we sent out soldiers into battle , some of whom did not come back , and some of whom came back wounded ,& rdquo ; said the minister . When asked if the Religious Zionist Party would leave the government if such a deal were signed , Strock responded with : & ldquo ; A government that sends out people to battle , that issues call - ups for hundreds of thousands of soldiers who left everything behind and went out to fight for those goals that the government defined , that tells them , & lsquo ; you know what ? Drop it . We & rsquo ; re throwing it all in the trash in order to save 22 or 33 people or who knows how many .& rsquo ;& rdquo ;& ldquo ; Such a government has absolutely no right to exist ,& rdquo ; Strock punctuated . Strock insisted that the party had softened its stance on lot of issues that were at the heart of its ideology as part of the war effort , pointing to the party & rsquo ; s support of the last hostage deal in November . The minister added that she believed that the first deal was & ldquo ; not a mistake ,& rdquo ; saying that she did not feel it harmed the war & rsquo ; s objective while the new deal did . When asked if the party & rsquo ; s drop in election polls had anything to do with her position , Strock stressed , & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m not interested in where I am in the polls ; I & rsquo ; m interested in where the State of Israel is in the war against the cruel enemy .& rdquo ; Strock sparks outrageStrock & rsquo ; s comments sparked outrage on Wednesday , with several politicians and relatives of hostages responding to her remarks . Minister - without - Portfolio Chili Tropper condemned Strock & rsquo ; s comments , saying , & ldquo ; You can support the outline for the release of the hostages , and you can oppose it , but the basic Jewish commandment of & lsquo ; anyone who preserves a single life in Israel is regarded as if he had preserved an entire world & rsquo ; should spare us insensitive , blunt statements about the terrible suffering of the hostages and their families & ndash ; like Minister Orit Strock & rsquo ; s words .& ldquo ; The way of Judaism is much more humane and sensitive to human life than those who sometimes seek to speak on its behalf ,& rdquo ; Tropper emphasized . Shir Siegel , the daughter of Keith Siegel , who is being held hostage in Gaza , responded to Strock & rsquo ; s comments as well , telling 103FM radio , & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s simply a disgrace , it & rsquo ; s contempt for human life at the highest levels .& rdquo ; Concerning Strock & rsquo ; s Religious Zionist Party , Siegel said , & ldquo ; They don & rsquo ; t deserve to run the country & ndash ; if they think eliminating another terrorist is more important than bringing my father back home alive , they should be ashamed .& rdquo ; Correspondingly , MK Matan Kahana wrote on X that Strock & rsquo ; s comments were & ldquo ; disconnected in such a deep way from the suffering of the hostages and their family members .& rdquo ; Yesh Atid responded to Strock & rsquo ; s remarks as well and said , & ldquo ; The government that is responsible for the greatest failure to the Jewish people since the Holocaust , with 1 , 300 dead and 133 Israelis who are still being held captive on its watch , has no right to exist ! Quit and go home . You are a shame to the country , to Zionism , and to religion .& rdquo ; Earlier on Wednesday , Education Minister Yoav Kisch rejected the complaints about the hostage negotiations made by National Security Minister Itamar Ben - Gvir and Minister - without - Portfolio Benny Gantz . השר @ YoavKisch מהליכוד אצל # ספי_ויניר על התנגדויות שרים בממשלה לעסקה : " מי שעושה סיבובים פוליטיים אלו הם , לא זזנו ממטרות המלחמה . אף אחד מהשרים שמקשקשים עכשיו לא רלוונטים לכל החלטה שהתקבלה ועוד תתקבל - אנחנו לא צריכים לא את בן גביר ולא את גנץ שיזכירו לנו דברים "@ sefiova @ yanircozin pic . twitter . com / hIY72Rb2xg & mdash ; גלצ (@ GLZRadio ) May 1 , 2024He told Army Radio , & ldquo ; They are the ones who make these political spins ... we have not changed the war & rsquo ; s aims .& ldquo ; None of the ministers who are nattering now are relevant to any decision that has been made and will be made .
