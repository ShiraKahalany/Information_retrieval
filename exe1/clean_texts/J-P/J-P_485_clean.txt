Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was coy about & nbsp ; media reports of a secret deal in which Israel agreed to purchase Russian Sputnik COVID - 19 vaccines on behalf of Syria as part of last week & rsquo ; s prisoner exchange with Syria .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Not a single Israeli COVID - 19 vaccine went for that matter ,& rdquo ; Netanyahu said at a public appearance on Saturday , during which he was quizzed on the issue by a KAN reporter .
& nbsp ;
Netanyahu referred to the deal brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin in which a young Israeli woman who had wandered into Syria was returned in exchange for the release of two Syrian shepherds .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We brought back the young woman and I have thanked President Putin for this , but I respect Russia & rsquo ; s request not to say anything more ,& rdquo ; Netanyahu said .
& nbsp ;
Speculation with regard to a secret component to the deal has been fueled by an unusual secret government meeting held Wednesday night in advance of an otherwise seemingly simple exchange .
& nbsp ;
Labor Party head MK Merav Michaeli appealed to Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Zvi Hauser to hold a debate on the decision to censor information about the deal .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; There is a real concern , sir , that Prime Minister Netanyahu and [ Alternate Prime Minister and ] Defense Minister [ Benny ] Gantz have abused their authority and censored the full details of the agreement to prevent a public debate & rdquo ; on the price of the deal , Michaeli said .
& nbsp ;
Among those who reported on the matter was Richard Silverstein in his Tikun Olam blog . & ldquo ; Today , a well - informed Israeli source has revealed the full extent of the negotiation . Russia , in order to sweeten the deal , proposed that Israel pay millions for several million doses of the former & rsquo ; s SPUTNIK COVID vaccine to be administered to millions of Syrians . Israel agreed ( hence the cabinet signoff ),& rdquo ; Silverstein wrote .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; But both Bibi Netanyahu and Benny Gantz do not want Israelis to know that they are offering such resources to Syria , especially because they are in the midst of the election campaign ,& rdquo ; he added .
& nbsp ;
Syria & rsquo ; s state news agency SANA rejected the report .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Circulating such fabricated information about a secret term in the exchange process , related to getting coronavirus vaccines from the Israeli authorities , aim to defame Syria and distort the patriotic and humanitarian side of the process ,& rdquo ; it stated .
& nbsp ;
According to KAN News , Israel requested permission from Russia to disclose what was promised to Syria under the prisoner swap deal , but the Kremlin reportedly has not & ldquo ; changed its position on the issue .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The issue was noted by Joint List faction chairman Ahmad Tibi in a Friday tweet .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Do we have to wait for a Jew to cross the border into Gaza in order for [ Palestinians ] to receive vaccines ?& rdquo ; Tibi wrote , following a comment on how he had raised a demand in the Knesset for vaccines to be transferred to Gaza . The young woman who crossed into Syria returned to Israel in the early hours of Friday , after government hostage negotiator Yaron Bloom headed to Moscow on Thursday night to bring her back .
& nbsp ;
On Thursday , the IDF handed over two shepherds to Red Cross representatives through the Quentin Crossing in Syria , after they had been apprehended by IDF troops east of the security fence in the Golan Heights area in Israeli territory .
& nbsp ;
Following her return , Netanyahu spoke with the young woman & rsquo ; s mother who thanked him for his efforts , according to a PMO statement . & ldquo ; Israel will always do everything in its power in order to help its citizens ,& rdquo ; Netanyahu said .
& nbsp ;
The prime minister also issued a statement thanking Putin for his efforts , noting he had spoken with him twice .
& nbsp ;
Gantz also released a statement explaining that he had spoken with his Russian counterpart on the matter and publicly thanked him .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Two weeks ago , we received an alert that an Israeli citizen had been taken into the custody of Syrian security forces . She willingly decided to cross the border - an incident which we & rsquo ; ll continue to investigate .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We immediately began working to ensure her swift return . We made clear that the woman was not in an official capacity and that this instance is humanitarian and not at all related to defense ,& rdquo ; Gantz said .
