The IDF prosecution on Thursday filed an indictment in the Judea Military Court against Muntasir Shalabi for the alleged murder of 19 - year - old Yehuda Guetta in a drive - by - shooting terror attack at Tapuah Junction on May 2 .
& nbsp ;
Shalabi , 44 , was also indicted on two other attempted murder counts due because two other 19 - year - olds were wounded in the attack .
& nbsp ;
The indictment was filed after evidence was gleaned by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) and the police .
& nbsp ;
Five other Palestinians have also recently been indicted for obstruction of justice by providing Shalabi with a hiding place during the initial manhunt and all five are being kept in police custody until the conclusion of their trials .
& nbsp ;
An additional suspect is also expected to be indicted shortly for harboring Shalabi in his efforts to avoid authorities .
& nbsp ;
Shalabi was eventually arrested in the town of Silwad .
& nbsp ;
A resident of Jerusalem , Guetta was a student in the Itamar Yeshiva . He is survived by his parents , four brothers and two sisters .

& ldquo ; Yehuda in the last few days , we worried as you fought for your life , we prayed from the depths of our hearts that you would overcome your wounds , and across the entire country we begged for your recovery , but this morning , to our great sorrow , these prayers have turned to a eulogy ,& rdquo ; the Mayor of Jerusalem , Moshe Lion , said solemnly at Guetta & rsquo ; s funeral on May 6 .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Our hearts are broken & ndash ; but our spirits are strong ,& rdquo ; Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan said , calling on the government to establish a settlement near Tapuah Junction in Guetta & rsquo ; s memory .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I send sincere condolences to Yehuda Guetta & rsquo ; s family ,& rdquo ; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said within minutes of hearing of the young man & rsquo ; s death .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; These are difficult moments for the Guetta family and the entire nation of Israel shares in your sorrow ,& rdquo ; he said .

& ldquo ; My heart goes out to the Guetta family who lost Yehuda tonight , only 19 - years - old , who was shot during the heinous terrorist attack at the Tapuah Junction ,& rdquo ; a statement by Defense Minister Benny Gantz read .
