The Knesset House Committee approved on Wednesday evening the split between Minister - without - Portfolio Benny Gantz & rsquo ; s National Unity Party and MK Gideon Sa & rsquo ; ar & rsquo ; s New Hope Party , which Sa & rsquo ; ar first announced during a speech on Tuesday evening .& ldquo ; A very large public believes in the path of a nationalist - liberal statesmanlike right wing , in the spirit of the worldviews of [ former prime ministers ] Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir ,& rdquo ; said New Hope MK Ze & rsquo ; ev Elkin . & ldquo ; Starting now , that public has an address in this Knesset , New Hope . A very large public feels that we are beginning to trod in place , we must invest in creative thinking to change how the war is conducted . We will fight for this change to happen .& rdquo ; Elkin said that the name of the new party will be called & ldquo ; Hayamin Hamamlachti ,& rdquo ; which translates roughly as the & ldquo ; Statesmanlike Right .& rdquo ; However , a spokesperson for Sa & rsquo ; ar said the name in English will continue to be New Hope until a formal translation is announced . MK Pnina Tamano - Shata of National Unity said at the committee meeting that the split was & ldquo ; a divorce that was known in advance ,& rdquo ; as the two factions ran in the election as separate entities in the same list , and never actually merged . Gantz was unaware of Sa ' ar ' s timingNational Unity head Gantz acknowledged in a press conference earlier on Wednesday that there were & ldquo ; challenges in the government & rsquo ; s conduct ,& rdquo ; and that & ldquo ; real operational needs and correct priorities were being harmed as a result of political conduct ,& rdquo ; but said that & ldquo ; now was not the time for politics .& ldquo ; Now we must concentrate on the unifying , [ on what & rsquo ; s ] correct , and victory . When the war ends , we will go to an election . Anyone who runs will explain what he & rsquo ; s proposing , and what he did during this difficult time for the country ,& rdquo ; Gantz said . Gantz & rsquo ; s responses during the question - and - answer session that followed his statement were uncharacteristically curt . He said that he was not aware of Sa & rsquo ; ar & rsquo ; s plan to announce the secession on Tuesday evening , but that he did know about Sa & rsquo ; ar & rsquo ; s plans in general . He added that & ldquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar & rsquo ; s decision to go on his path is his decision . We will find ways to put out a list as good as ours and even bigger but of no less quality . We will do this the correct way ,& rdquo ; Gantz said . In his speech on Tuesday evening , Sa & rsquo ; ar explained that his decision to split from Gantz was due to what he claimed was the latter & rsquo ; s unwillingness to ramp up operations in Gaza and to achieve the war & rsquo ; s goal of completely eradicating Hamas .& ldquo ; For a long time , my friends and I have not hidden our criticism of the campaign & rsquo ; s navigation by the reduced [ war ] cabinet ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said . He also demanded to become a member of the war cabinet himself . Gantz said in response on Wednesday that & ldquo ; what isn & rsquo ; t broken doesn & rsquo ; t need fixing ,& rdquo ; and there was no reason to bring Sa & rsquo ; ar into the war cabinet . Sa & rsquo ; ar responded to Gantz shortly afterward in a post on X .& ldquo ; I chose to separate from Gantz respectfully . Unfortunately , Gantz & rsquo ; s opposition to my joining the war cabinet is not candid and not for reasons for the good of the country .& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar accused Gantz of opposing bringing on Yisrael Beytenu chairman MK Avigdor Liberman for the same reason . He added that it was not accurate to say that everything was working , since & ldquo ; a very broad public feels and knows that there is a lot to change in the small cabinet & rsquo ; s navigation of the war .& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar added that & ldquo ; at this stage , we should be after an operation in Rafah and finishing the job in the refugee camps in central Gaza .& rdquo ;
