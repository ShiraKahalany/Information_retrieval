The share of Israeli Jews who believe an Israeli and a Palestinian state can peacefully coexist has plummeted since October 7 , according to a new survey . The figure of 19 %, reported in a study published Thursday by the Pew Research Center , was the lowest since Pew started surveying Israelis in 2013 . It is down from 32 % in a survey released just weeks before the war broke out . In 2013 , according to Pew , nearly half of Israeli Jews & mdash ; and a majority of Israelis overall & mdash ; supported a two - state solution . In 2005 , another polling firm found that most Israeli Jews supported the establishment of a Palestinian state . This year , a quarter of Israeli adults overall & mdash ; including nearly half of Israeli Arabs & nbsp ;& mdash ; believe a Palestinian state and Israel can peacefull exist side - by - side . That takeaway is one of a number from Thursday & rsquo ; s Pew survey that show Israelis hunkering down for more conflict as the Israel - Hamas war is about to enter its eighth month . The survey of roughly 1 , 000 Israeli adults was taken in March and April & mdash ; before Israel & rsquo ; s invasion of the Gaza city of Rafah and other recent developments & mdash ; and has a margin of error of 4 %. The survey also shows wide gaps between Jewish and Arab respondents . Among Arab Israelis , for example , 74 % say & ldquo ; Israel & rsquo ; s military response against Hamas in Gaza has gone too far .& rdquo ; Only four percent of Jewish Israelis agree . And while 76 % of Jewish Israelis say Israel will achieve its goals in the war , only half as many Arab Israelis , 38 %, say the same . But Israeli Arabs and Jews share some of the same concerns about the war : 61 % of both groups are worried about the war spreading to other fronts & mdash ; a concern that has been top - of - mind for many in the region and beyond after constant exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon , the first direct attacks between Iran and Israel and violence on other fronts . And at a time when Tzachi Hanegbi , Israel & rsquo ; s national security adviser , said he anticipated the war will last until the end of this year , the poll found that significant majorities of both groups ( 77 % of Arabs , 66 % of Jews ) are worried about the war & ldquo ; lasting a long time .& rdquo ; Some 40 % of Israeli believe Israel should control Gaza postwarThe poll also measured one of the most vexing and divisive questions of the war : Who should control Gaza when the battles are over . The lack of a detailed plan for a postwar scenario has led to rifts within Israel & rsquo ; s government as well as between Israel and the United States . The poll found that 40 % percent of Israelis , including half of the Jewish respondents , believe that Israel should continue to control the territory in a postwar scenario , while 18 % believe it should be run by a version of the Palestinian Authority & mdash ; which governs Palestinian population centers in the West Bank but which Netanyahu has shut out . Meanwhile , 14 % say people who live in Gaza should decide who governs them . Nine percent of Arab Israelis , and 2 % of Jewish Israelis , say Hamas should continue to rule the enclave . In addition to being taken before the launch of the Rafah operation , the poll was conducted before other landmark developments of recent weeks & mdash ; including a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court announcing he was seeking Netanyahu & rsquo ; s arrest and President Joe Biden saying that he would suspend delivery of some large bombs to Israel in a bid to influence the scope of Israel & rsquo ; s Rafah invasion . But even before those events , the poll showed disapproval of Biden & rsquo ; s handling of the war rising in Israel . Biden was broadly popular among Israelis for his embrace of the country following Oct . 7 , but by the time the poll was taken , 60 % percent of Israeli Jews & mdash ; and 86 % of Israeli Arabs & mdash ; said they did not approve of how he was handling the war . Also unpopular was Netanyahu who , the poll found , had a lower favorability rating than at any point in the 11 years Pew has asked the question , at 41 %. The two other leaders in his war cabinet , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz , fared better , with Gantz at 51 % and Gallant at 61 %. A more recent poll shows that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s popularity , which nosedived after Oct . 7 , is recovering among the Israeli public .
