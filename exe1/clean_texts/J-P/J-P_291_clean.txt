Advancement of Palestinian building projects for Area C of the West Bank must receive Security Cabinet approval prior to any IDF debate on the matter , Community Affairs Minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Friday .
& nbsp ;
He sent a letter on the issue to Alternative Prime Minister and Defense Minister Benny Gantz in advance of Sunday & rsquo ; s anticipated meeting of the Higher Planning Council for Judea and Samaria .
& nbsp ;
The Council , which oversees Israeli and Palestinian construction in Area C ,& nbsp ; plans to debate Palestinian projects . Israeli approval for Palestinian building projects in Area C is rare and often sets off a storm of controversy among the Right , which believes that such projects might decide who will control Area C in the future . At present Area C is under IDF military and civilian control .
& nbsp ;
The Right fears that Palestinian building in Area C is part of a Palestinian Authority plan to retain as much control over Area C as possible .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; A review of some of the plans shows that the Security Cabinet may have rejected some of them in the past ,& rdquo ; he said .
& nbsp ;
Of particular concern is a plan to expand the Palestinian villages of al - Wallaja and Hizma , both of which are near Jerusalem , Hanegbi said .
& nbsp ;
He called on Gantz to cancel the Higher Planning Council meeting on Palestinian building and to seek Security Cabinet approval prior to moving forward on the matter .
& nbsp ;
Separately on Sunday the Higher Planning Council , which is under the auspices of the IDF & rsquo ; s Civil Administration , was expected to advance plans for 800 housing units in West Bank settlements .
