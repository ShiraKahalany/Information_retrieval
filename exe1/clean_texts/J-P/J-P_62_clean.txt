The politics is getting out of control , and the question is whether it puts the fate of the hostages and the objective of defeating Hamas at risk .& nbsp ; White House officials insist that they were taken aback by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s announcement that he was calling off a trip to Washington by a delegation headed by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer , after the US refused to thwart a UN Security Council resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza . The Biden administration is familiar with the players in Netanyahu & rsquo ; s circle . Hanegbi and Dermer , the latter in particular , are the prime minister & rsquo ; s people . US officials acknowledge that with this decision to call off the trip , Netanyahu was & ldquo ; putting his foot down ,& rdquo ; feeling increasing heat personally from the administration over how he is running Israel & rsquo ; s affairs .& ldquo ; Minister Benny Gantz was here earlier this month , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is here now , [ and ] the defense establishments are in constant contact ,& rdquo ; a White House aide argued . & ldquo ; Calling off the Hanegbi - Dermer delegation is political window dressing by the prime minister .& rdquo ; In response to the question of whether the administration was also acting politically & ndash ; by supporting Israel but looking over its shoulder amid the president & rsquo ; s re - election campaign to make sure it didn & rsquo ; t alienate its electorate too much & ndash ; a White House aide insisted : & ldquo ; Israel has no better friend than the Biden administration , in general & ndash ; and regarding Gaza , in particular .& rdquo ; On the one hand , the aide seemed to be charging that Netanyahu was not sufficiently appreciating the administration & rsquo ; s obstacle course in navigating its policy regarding Gaza , and that calling off the visit to Washington by his delegation only exacerbated the public impression & ldquo ; that the two countries are not on the same side .& rdquo ; On the other hand , the aide reiterated that & ldquo ; on the ground , our cooperation is not affected .& rdquo ; Biden on Netanyahu ' s governance & nbsp ; In a recent MSNBC interview , President Joe Biden charged that Netanyahu was doing more harm than good ; he has also publicly questioned Israel & rsquo ; s plans for a Rafah operation . However , a White House aide insisted that the president & rsquo ; s endgame remains & ldquo ; the defeat of Hamas .& rdquo ; Yet , regarding Hanegbi and Dermer staying home , instead of visiting Washington at least right now , administration officials seem fine with holding high - profile contacts in the US capital with high - level Israeli officials who themselves have tense relations with Netanyahu . The president and his people are aware of domestic issues in Israel , including the resistance by Gallant and Gantz to Netanyahu & rsquo ; s moves on the matter of haredi ( ultra - Orthodox ) enlistment in the IDF . Within the Biden administration , there isn & rsquo ; t totally smooth sailing either . Officials have acknowledged that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the & ldquo ; weak link & rdquo ; in support for the Israeli campaign in Gaza . Yet , said one official , & ldquo ; she is toeing the line and in principle supports what the Israeli mission is all about ,& rdquo ; even if her pronouncements at times & ldquo ; seem more blunt about what Israel is doing wrong .& rdquo ; Biden has stronger support for his Gaza policy , say aides , from Secretary of State Antony Blinken , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan . Some aides seem to hint that having Harris playing & ldquo ; bad cop & rdquo ; with some of her declarations on Israel allows Biden to hope he can placate those who say they would vote for him in November , but are threatening not to do so over what some even call his support for & ldquo ; genocide .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; Listen , the [ UN ] Security Council called for a ceasefire , but it also called for a release of the hostages ,& rdquo ; argued a Biden aide . & ldquo ; We have not abandoned Israel , [ and ] we have not abandoned the Israeli mission in Gaza . We have also not abandoned the need for humanitarian aid and working toward the overall well - being of Palestinians in Gaza . Cooperation is key - but difficult in attaining & nbsp ;& ldquo ; The question is what is the best way to achieve all these goals ; it is challenging ,& rdquo ; the aide said . & ldquo ; We want to work with the Israelis . We want to work with them on how to achieve victory over Hamas in general , and how best to achieve the aims of a Rafah operation in particular , but not in a way & ndash ; as both the president and vice president have said & ndash ; that would lead to a civilian bloodbath . And yes , we want the return of the hostages .& rdquo ; Biden & rsquo ; s re - election campaign advisers continue to watch the Gaza policy closely . The president is said to be feeling the heat over warnings he is receiving that he has a very thin tightrope to walk on : promoting his policy but not risking defeat in November . & ldquo ; Gaza is not the only reason for concern ,& rdquo ; conceded a Biden political adviser , & ldquo ; but it & rsquo ; s a big reason .& rdquo ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s announcement & ndash ; calling off the visit by the Hanegbi - Dermer delegation to Washington to discuss Rafah policy and how to release the hostages & ndash ; came as the prime minister was battling for his political life , warning coalition naysayers to the proposals regarding haredi military recruitment that if an agreement is not reached , the government would fall . So apparently , the US and Israeli landscapes both currently abound with political window dressing by the two leaders , Biden and Netanyahu . Such behavior is not rare in the political world , but right now , if these maneuvers by the president and prime minister do in fact get out of control , the ramifications could be extremely dangerous and deadly .
