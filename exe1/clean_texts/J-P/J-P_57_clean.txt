On July 9 , the Security Cabinet decided by a majority of eight to one ( National Security Minister Itamar Ben - Gvir voted against ) with one abstention ( Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich ) that Israel would act to prevent the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s collapse . This is the official translation of the resolution presented by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu :& ldquo ; In the absence of a change in the national assessment , Israel will act to prevent the collapse of the Palestinian Authority , while demanding that it cease its anti - Israel activity in the international legal - diplomatic arena , the incitement in its media and education system , the payments to the families of terrorists and murderers , and the illegal construction in Area C .& rdquo ; The statement added that the prime minister and the defense minister would submit proposed steps to stabilize the civilian situation in the Palestinian arena . These include the construction of a new industrial zone in Tarkumiye , near Hebron , a move supported by the Israeli security establishment .& nbsp ; As part of the effort by Israel and Egypt to boost the Palestinian economy , the Prime Minister ' s Office recently approved the development of a natural gas field off the Gaza coast to be administered by the PA .& nbsp ; Why does Israel want to save the PA ? According to Israeli officials , the decision to help the PA is aimed at countering the influence in the West Bank of Iran , which backs both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad . The officials say that the collapse of the PA could cause a similar situation to that in Gaza , where Hamas seized control in 2007 . They argue that the PA & rsquo ; s loss of control , particularly in the northern West Bank , has empowered terrorist groups and forced the IDF to conduct counter - terror operations in the territories .& nbsp ; Ben - Gvir called the decision to strengthen the PA & ldquo ; delusional .& rdquo ; He said : & ldquo ; There is no greater absurdity than the fact that a body that encourages terrorism , pays salaries to terrorists and their families , encourages in the education system incitement in favor of the murder of Jews , and takes over territories in Judea and Samaria , will receive a basket of rewards from the Israeli government in the midst of a wave of terrorism .& rdquo ; It is worth noting that the Israeli government collects some NIS 800 million annually in taxes for the PA , accounting for up to 70 % of its revenue , excluding foreign aid .& nbsp ; On July 10 , the PA rejected Israel & rsquo ; s demands for helping to prevent its collapse . & ldquo ; Yesterday , the Israeli government came out with decisions concerning the Palestinian Authority on the pretext that they want to offer gestures to the Palestinians ,& rdquo ; PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told a PA cabinet meeting . & ldquo ; On behalf of the Palestinian government , we say that what is required of Israel is to halt its aggression on our people , killings , settlements , and the piracy of our money .& rdquo ; Established 30 years ago as part of the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords with Israel , the PA has weakened considerably over recent years amid allegations of corruption and incompetence , and opposition to its security cooperation with Israel . As a result , it is facing an increased threat from Hamas and PIJ . PA President Mahmoud Abbas was elected on January 9 , 2005 , for a four - year - term , and the last elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council were held on January 25 , 2006 . It is possible that neither he nor his Fatah faction would win elections in the territories if they were held today , and questions remain about the 87 - year - old leader & rsquo ; s successor . Recent Palestinian polls show that Abbas & rsquo ; s popularity has plunged , with 80 % saying he should resign . & nbsp ; According to a poll of Palestinians conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research , & ldquo ; For the first time since the creation of the PA , a majority says that its dissolution or collapse serves the interest of the Palestinian people .& rdquo ; What does this mean for the future of the PA and Israel ? That is the focus of this issue .& nbsp ;
