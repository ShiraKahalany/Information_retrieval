Israel will not negotiate a ceasefire before Hamas pays a price for its attacks , a senior Israeli official said on Tuesday .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Hamas fired a bunch of rockets , and then of course they want a ceasefire , that @@@ s perfect for them , they don @@@ t have to pay a price for firing on Jerusalem and then 500 rockets ,& rdquo ; the official said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; There will be a ceasefire when we @@@ re ready for it ,& rdquo ; he added .
& nbsp ;
The official would not confirm or deny a report on Channel 12 News that Israel declined an Egyptian offer to negotiate a ceasefire , nor that Egypt put forward an offer at all .

Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi spoke to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken .
& nbsp ;
Ashkenazi & quot ; emphasized that Israel has the right to defend its sovereignty and will not allow attempts to hurt its citizens .& quot ; He said Israel will continue to use a heavy hand against Hamas terrorists .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; Hamas chose the path of terrorism and shot over 600 rockets at civilian populations in Jerusalem , the capital of Israel , and the center of Israel and its south , hurting dozens of innocent people and killing three ,& quot ; he added .
& nbsp ;
Ashkenazi thanked Blinken for US support for Israel @@@ s right to defend itself . He also called on the international community to condemn Hamas terrorism and the rocket fire from Gaza , rather than give a prize to terrorism .
