Minister - without - portfolio Gadi Eisenkot ( National Unity ) criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday over his honesty and policies regarding Iran and Saudi Arabia . Under Netanyahu & rsquo ; s leadership , the cabinet had failed to govern properly and restore security , he said . In response , the Likud said Eisenkot and Minister - without - portfolio Benny Gantz , National Unity & rsquo ; s chairman , were looking for excuses to & ldquo ; end the war without achieving its goals & rdquo ; and topple the government . Netanyahu had until June 8 to meet several conditions , Gantz said on May 18 , or else he and his party would leave the government . Gantz set the deadline for Netanyahu to present a comprehensive plan for & ldquo ; the day after & rdquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s rule in Gaza , including freeing the hostages , installing a civilian governing body composed of both international and Palestinian officials , and enabling evacuees from the North to return home by September 1 .& ldquo ; Instead of engaging in the pursuit of victory , they are engaging in petty politics ,& rdquo ; the Likud said in a press release . National Unity said Netanyahu had failed to bring victory on the battlefield and was wasting his time on maneuvering in a political minefield instead of a real one .& ldquo ; Wars are not won with slogans ,& rdquo ; National Unity said in a press release . & ldquo ; The eternal [ Jewish ] people are not afraid of the long journey .& rdquo ; Labor Party MK Gilad Kariv also criticized Netanyahu . & ldquo ; His words give further validity to the feeling of the majority of the Israeli public ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; Netanyahu is not qualified to lead the State of Israel at this complex time , and his continued rule constitutes a security , political , and economic danger .& rdquo ; Kariv said National Unity should leave the government and called for new elections . Channel 12 political commentator Amit Segal said Eisenkot & rsquo ; s remarks had been directed at the political Center , not the people who already agree with him . This could have a ripple effect since joining the government gave it legitimacy , especially against the protest movement , but that could now change , he said . Netanyahu met with opposition leader Yair Lapid on Wednesday . The meeting lasted about 40 minutes and was attended by Military Secretary Roman Gofman , who was present throughout . Deprivation and discriminationLapid also met on Wednesday with Minister - without - portfolio Gideon Sa & rsquo ; ar ( National Unity ) and Yisrael Beytenu chairman Avigdor Liberman . The coalition was on the verge of collapse , Lapid said Wednesday .& ldquo ; The disagreements between them are deep ,& rdquo ; he told the N12 news site . & ldquo ; That is clear to anyone who heard Eisenkot today .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; We have been in talks this whole time ,& rdquo ; Lapid said , referring to his meeting with Sa & rsquo ; ar and Liberman , & ldquo ; but there are no significant moves we can make until Gantz and Eisenkot pull out of the government . There are so many people walking around now with absolute hopelessness , even inside the Likud . The cracks are there , and they will keep forming . This government is failing by every measure . Things are falling apart , and Likud MKs see that .& rdquo ; The coalition suffered another attack when United Torah Judaism chairman Moshe Gafni threatened to leave the government if funding for haredi education was not addressed . A kindergarten teacher in Kiryat Shmona was not receiving her salary because she is haredi , while secular teachers in Safed and Ma & rsquo ; alot had received theirs , he said in the Knesset plenum .& ldquo ; I have to say that there is deprivation [ and ] discrimination , [ and ] it & rsquo ; s wrong ,& rdquo ; Gafni said .& ldquo ; The education system isn & rsquo ; t functioning in the North , yet the kindergarten teacher in Safed and the kindergarten teacher in Ma & rsquo ; alot received a salary ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; Only if the kindergarten teacher is haredi she doesn & rsquo ; t receive a salary . The secular MKs disappointed me .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; I have been in the Knesset for many , many years , and I was taught that everyone should receive the same salary ; that there should be equality ,& rdquo ; Gafni said . & ldquo ; Why does someone who lives and works in Kiryat Shmona with a low salary [ not receive the same treatment ]? Why doesn & rsquo ; t this kindergarten teacher who teaches children get the same salary ?& rdquo ; Israel Hayom quoted several officials in the Finance Ministry as saying Gafni was drumming up support among his haredi base , and the issue he raised had already been resolved the night before in a committee meeting .
