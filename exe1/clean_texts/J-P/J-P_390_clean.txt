ArtForum magazine , a leading international contemporary art magazine , published an article in its Summer 2021 edition featuring an interview with strongly anti - Israel rhetoric and claims that Israel is ethnic cleansing Palestinians .
& nbsp ;
The article interviewed Hanan Toukan , an assistant professor in politics and Middle East studies at Bard College Berlin , and Adila La & iuml ; di - Hanieh , the director - general of the Palestinian Museum , located north of Ramallah in Birzeit in the West Bank .
& nbsp ;
The interview broadly accuses Israel of illegally refusing to vaccinate Palestinians , engaging in & ldquo ; violent cleansing & rdquo ; of residents of Sheikh Jarrah , of arbitrary killings of Palestinians , and subjecting Palestinians to & ldquo ; obliteration from one of the most brutal militaries in the world .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Toukan and La & iuml ; di - Hanieh described how the museum is part of an & ldquo ; anti - colonial struggle & rdquo ; against Israel and is necessary to reclaim the Palestinian narrative and history .
& nbsp ;
In the opening of the interview , Toukan described when the museum opened that & ldquo ; writers considered what such a museum meant in the colonial context of Palestine , its relation to the land on which it exists , and how this relation reveals processes of dispossession and appeals for reclamation that define life under Israeli colonialism .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The interview also described the unique role that the Palestinian Museum plays in opposition to a global context of & ldquo ; ivory - tower museum [ s ].& rdquo ; The article specifically denounces the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as a continuation of the British colonial legacy , because it displays items from Gaza , Nablus , and Jericho .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Palestine is on its own , and the museum and concomitant cultural projects become a testament not only to survival in the face of eradication but to ingenuity in response to structural inequalities ,& rdquo ; Toukan said .
& nbsp ;
La & iuml ; di - Hanieh further described the importance of the museum in this context : & ldquo ; The colonial neoliberal dispensation under which we live & mdash ; the reign of the consultant and the freelancer & mdash ; leads to a generalized weakness and hollowing out of Palestinian institutions ; it is killing the cultural sector .& rdquo ;
