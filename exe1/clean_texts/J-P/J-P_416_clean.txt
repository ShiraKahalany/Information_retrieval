Israel Police are investigating the cause of death of a woman in her 50s whose body was found early Monday morning in the & nbsp ; Reihan Forest in the northern West Bank . The police and Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) are reportedly evaluating whether the murder might have been a terrorist attack .

& quot ; We wake up to a difficult and painful event in the northern Shomron ,& quot ; said MK & nbsp ; Betzalel Smotrich upon hearing the news . & quot ; We send our condolences to the family of the 14th murdered woman [ this year ] and ask to embrace and strengthen the residents of Tal Menashe and the entire Shomron community .

& quot ; The security forces will , with God @@@ s help , get their hands on the perpetrators of this terrible attack and bring them justice ,& quot ; the MK concluded .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
The woman , Esther Hurgan , was a resident of Tel Menashe , a town near the forest . Her body was found on the side of the road in the forest , marked by signs of violence , including to her head . Her family reported her missing on Sunday . She leaves behind her husband , Benyamin , and six children . Her youngest child celebrated his bar mitzvah just three months ago .

IDF soldiers were called to the scene alongside police after the body was found . 

The Samaria Regional Council referred to the incident as a terrorist attack , adding that Hurgan was found overnight with & quot ; her head crushed .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
& quot ; A dear woman so full of kindness , goes out in the afternoon in the center of the State of Israel to exercise a minute away from her home , and is murdered by vile people in such a cruel way ,& quot ; said the head of the Samaria Regional Council , Yossi Dagan . & quot ; I ask @@@ what barbarians , like in the Middle Ages , what cruelty to hack the face of a 52 - year - old woman with a rock in cold - blood ? What evil are we facing ?@@@& quot ;

He added : & quot ; I want to say clearly to these barbarians from the Palestinian Authority in front of the whole world : you will never break us . The settlements in Samaria will flourish and grow and build together with the whole State of Israel , because you in the barbaric Palestinian Authority chose death and we chose life . You act like barbarians from the Middle Ages & ndash ; and we are in 2020 and the people of Israel will win .& quot ;

& quot ; The late Esther Hurgan was brutally murdered when she went for a run near her home ,& quot ; said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the incident . & quot ; The security forces will get their hands on the killer as soon as possible and we will bring him to justice . I would like to send my deepest condolences to the family .& quot ;

& quot ; I send my deepest sympathies to the Horgan family on the horrific murder of Esther , of blessed memory ,& quot ; said Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz in response to the incident . & quot ; Israel & rsquo ; s security forces are working to find the despicable murderer and take him promptly into custody . We will never accept a reality in which human life becomes dispensable .& quot ;

President Reuven Rivlin commented on the murder , saying : & quot ; This is a hard , heart - breaking morning with news of the cruel murder of Esther Hurgan , who left her house yesterday and did not return . A full life of wonderful works & ndash ; of home and family , of creativity and care & ndash ; has been cut short by a beast in human guise . I have full faith that our security forces will get to the despicable murders and that justice will be done . I embrace Esther @@@ s family , her children and their father . We are with you in this time of such deep grief .& quot ;

& quot ; Esther went out yesterday as she was used to , to walk in nature , which she loved so much here around the settlement ,& quot ; said Benyamin , Esther @@@ s husband . & quot ; No adventurous deeds , a walking trail like every normal place in the country & ndash ; and she did not return . It does not suit her , so full of life and light and love for everyone , and all this is cut off in an instant . Who can do such a thing ?& quot ;
& nbsp ;
& quot ; We should all be here in the settlement in the regional council , all the people of Israel , and give the appropriate Zionist answer to acts of destruction and killing with more light , more life , more construction , more creation , and more action on the ground for our children and all the people of Israel ,& quot ; he stressed .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; Esther raised a family for glory , loved her grandchildren and now they will have no mother , no grandmother ,& quot ; the bereaved husband said . & quot ; Esther will be missed by all of us , the family and everyone who knew her . Before I knew what was going on , I got messages from all sorts of people how much she touched them and how much she did . We see the great success of the family and of the community in general , and that is largely due to her .& quot ;


 
& quot ; We start the morning with the sad news of the brutal murder of Esther Hurgan , a mother of six , last night in Samaria . It cannot be that a woman goes for a run and does not return home ,& quot ; said Jerusalem Affairs Minister Rafi Peretz . & quot ; I trust the security and police forces to lay hands on the perpetrator of this heinous crime , and I send my condolences to the grieving family .& quot ;

& quot ; The murder of Esther Hurgan , a mother of six , is heartbreaking . Such cruelty and evil ,& quot ; said opposition leader Yair Lapid . & quot ; I send condolences to the family and am sure that the security forces will catch the heinous killer .& quot ;

& quot ; My heart weeps over the murder of the late Esther Hurgan , a mother of six from Samaria & ndash ; all she did was go for a run near her home ,& quot ; said Yisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman . & quot ; I send my condolences to the family and hope that the IDF and the security forces will reach those responsible for the murder soon .& quot ;
