& nbsp ; The IDF struck a number of military sites belonging to Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday night in response to 20 fires sparked by incendiary balloons earlier in the day .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; The IDF is prepared for all scenarios , including the resumption of hostilities , in the face of continued terrorist acts from the Gaza Strip ,& quot ; said the IDF Spokesperson @@@ s Unit in a statement .




Hamas responded to the strikes on Tuesday night , calling the strikes & quot ; a failed attempt to stop our people & rsquo ; s solidarity and resistance with the Holy City , and to cover up the unprecedented state of confusion for the Zionist establishment in organizing the so - called @@@ Flag March .@@@& quot ;

The strikes come after dozens of Palestinians rioted and clashed with the IDF along the Gaza border on Tuesday , as tensions rose surrounding a flag march through the Old City of Jerusalem .

& nbsp ;
During the clashes , a Palestinian within a small group of instigators was shot in the leg and was taken away from the scene in light condition , according to Palestinian media . Israeli forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at rioters in order to disperse them .

Video from southern Israel on Tuesday afternoon showed large amounts of smoke in the border area due to the riots . The riots continued into the night as the Night Confusion Units in Gaza returned to operation , launching explosives and burning tires . One Palestinian was shot by the IDF during the riots on Tuesday evening .

A number of fires broke out in southern Israel on Tuesday , with at least 20 fires sparked by incendiary balloons launched from Gaza . Earlier in the day , Palestinian media published photos of terrorists preparing such balloons to launch towards Israel .

At least one explosive balloon was reported over southern Israel , with residents reporting that they saw and heard the balloon explode in the air , according to Israeli media .

Three Gazans were arrested by the IDF after they crossed the Gaza border fence into Israel , according to Palestinian reports .
& nbsp ;
As part of security preparations in light of the flag march , the paths of flights to and from Ben - Gurion Airport were diverted to leave and arrive from the North on Tuesday .

Iron Dome anti - missile defense units were also reinforced ahead of the march , amid threats by Hamas in recent days and weeks .

On Tuesday evening , Defense Minister Benny Gantz held a situation assessment with IDF Chief of Staff Aviv Kohavi , Shin Bet head Nadav Argaman , IDF Intelligence Directorate head Maj .- Gen . Tamir Heiman , IDF intelligence analysis chief Brig .- Gen . Amit Saar and Defense Ministry Policy and Political - Military Bureau head Zohar Palti .
& nbsp ;
No further information about the meeting was released in the statement by Gantz @@@ s office .

Despite the lack of rocket fire , Hamas celebrated what it termed a & quot ; confirmation & quot ; of the deterrence situation after Operation Guardian of the Walls , after Israel changed flight paths and the path of the flag march and intensified the deployment of the Iron Dome due to concerns of rocket fire .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; The courageous stances of the Palestinian resistance , and its decisive decisions that forced the Israeli occupation to change the path of the so - called march of flags away from the blessed Al - Aqsa Mosque , change the path of civil aviation , and intensify the deployment of the Iron Dome , confirm the achievement of the deterrence equation it imposed in the Battle of Saif al - Quds , and its success in imposing & nbsp ; new rules of engagement on the enemy ,& quot ; said Hamas on Tuesday night .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; The valiant resistance will remain the protective shield for our people , and the behavior of the Israeli occupation on the ground will determine the course and nature of dealing with it ,& quot ; added Hamas .

Former Military Intelligence head Amos Yadlin told Army Radio on Wednesday morning that , while Operation Guardian of the Walls had achieved a & quot ; great deal & quot ; of deterrence , it had not achieved complete deterrence , as evidenced by the incendiary balloons .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; Hamas threatened , but remembered what happened to it when it fired on Jerusalem - so it did not fire yesterday ,& quot ; added Yadlin . & quot ; There is a miss opportunity to create new rules . If Hamas knows that after burning fields we will attack empty compounds - it will continue .& quot ;



After Operation Guardian of the Walls & nbsp ; in mid - May , Gantz warned that Israel would respond forcefully to any act of aggression against Israel .
& nbsp ;
While Gantz stressed that he & quot ; wasn @@@ t promising & quot ; to attack for & quot ; every rocket or balloon at 3 a . m .& quot ; he added that he would attack when it was & quot ; convenient & quot ; for Israel .

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has also made statements in the past warning that incendiary balloons would be treated like rockets .
& nbsp ;

The Hamas terrorist movement had called for a & quot ; Day of Rage & quot ; to confront the long - awaited and controversial flag march on Tuesday , encouraging Palestinians to & quot ; mobilize & quot ; at al - Aqsa and the Old City of Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; Let next Tuesday be a day of mobilization and a bond towards al - Aqsa Mosque , and a day of anger and defiance of the occupier ,& quot ; said Hamas in a statement on Sunday . & quot ; Show God and your people what you have done in it , and be the best sword for Jerusalem and Al - Aqsa .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
Palestinian Islamic Jihad released a statement on Tuesday stating that it will respond & quot ; with full force to the provocations of the settlers in the Holy City ,& quot ; ahead of the flag march being held later in the evening .
& nbsp ;
PIJ called for Palestinians to gather throughout Jerusalem , especially at al - Aqsa Mosque and in areas where the flag march is scheduled to pass .
& nbsp ;
Additional Palestinian groups echoed the calls , calling for a confrontation with Israel if Jerusalem is & quot ; violated .& quot ;

Despite the threats , the march took place with relatively little violence . Some clashes were reported between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in east Jerusalem and the West Bank , but they had largely ended by Tuesday evening .
