National Security Minister Itamar Ben - Gvir has summoned Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai for a hearing set to take place on Wednesday , seeking to end his term early , Israeli media reported on Monday . In response to the developments , the Movement for Quality Government in Israel ( MQG ) said it would appeal this decision & nbsp ; to Israel & rsquo ; s High Court . Attorney General Gali Baharav - Miara reportedly told Ben - Gvir that inviting the police commissioner to such a hearing was illegal . Attorney General ' s statements & ldquo ;& ldquo ; Summoning the commissioner for a hearing by the minister , with empty claims of & lsquo ; dysfunction ,& rsquo ; is a blatant attempt to interfere with the independence of the police and the powers of the professional echelon , the MQG stated . & ldquo ; This is a clear deviation from the minister & rsquo ; s powers and a violation of the rule of law .& rdquo ; Ben - Gvir has made previous statements about his intentions to replace Shabtai and has already recommended Avshalom Peled as a candidate . Ben - Gvir and Shabtai have clashed on numerous issues , including the Meron disaster for which Ben - Gvir blamed Shabtai . The two also clashed over Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s announcement in March 2023 that he would remove Tel Aviv District Police Chief Ami Eshed over & nbsp ; lax police conduct during the judicial reform protests . Shabtai later claimed the decision to be Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s , saying that Eshed would remain in his post until the Attorney - General intervened on the matter .& nbsp ; The Jerusalem Post Staff and Maariv contributed to this report .& nbsp ;
