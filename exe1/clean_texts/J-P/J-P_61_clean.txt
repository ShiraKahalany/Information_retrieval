The question of whether photos depicting Hamas terrorists in submissive positions contribute to Israel ' s war objectives or hinder them intensifies with the increasing frequency of such images being released . As the IDF intensifies operations in the southern Gaza Strip , the security establishment must take a stance on this matter , which appears to divide opinions . While these photos may humiliate Hamas , a former senior security official suggests they may not truly serve our interests . " These photos are intended to resonate with the Israeli public , albeit within a specific demographic , but their effectiveness is uncertain ," the former official said . Are the photos of surrendering Hamas terrorists in Gaza staged ? The same official raises concerns about some events appearing staged . For instance , in a recently released video , an elderly man in his underwear can be seen moving to the front of the line and placing his weapon down . This particular photo raises numerous questions , according to the official ." Under what circumstances would someone undress before surrendering their weapon ?" they pointed out . " Logically , the weapon should be surrendered first , followed by removing clothes ." Additionally , the official points out that not everyone there is a terrorist . Some people are questioned in the field and released , while only a few undergo further investigation in Israel . The official concludes that engaging in a humiliation contest with Hamas is not worth it . He highlights that Hamas possesses videos from October 7 of Israelis in equally humiliating positions . Attempting to boost national morale through this , he warns , may result in psychological damage on the international stage .
