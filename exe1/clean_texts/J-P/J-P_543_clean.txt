The Palestinian Authority and several Palestinian factions said on Thursday that they see the recent tensions in the Negev as part of Israeli measures against & ldquo ; all Palestinians ,& rdquo ; including the Arab citizens of Israel .
Voicing full support for the Bedouin citizens of the Negev , the PA and the Palestinian factions called for stepping up the protests against Israel & rsquo ; s practices .
The tensions erupted this week when Bedouin citizens protested the planting of trees by Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael - Jewish National Fund on disputed lands in the Negev .
According to the Palestinians , the tree - planting in the Negev comes in the context of Israel & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; settlement policy & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; crimes & rdquo ; in the West Bank , Jerusalem and Gaza Strip .
The PA and the Palestinian factions refer to the Arab Israelis , including the Bedouin , as & ldquo ; Palestinians & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; the Arabs of 1948 .& rdquo ;

Some of the factions called on the Bedouin citizens to launch an intifada ( uprising ) in protest of the Israeli attempts to confiscate & ldquo ; Arab - owned lands .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; The crimes of the occupation state in the Negev are an extension of it war on the Palestinians ,& rdquo ; the PA Foreign Ministry said in a statement .
& ldquo ; The ministry strongly condemns the heinous crime committed by the occupation state against the Palestinian Arabs of the Negev and their lands and properties . This is a continuation of the war waged by Israel to destroy the future of Palestinian generations and force them to emigrate in order to replace them with settlers . The Palestinian people in the State of Palestine are paying a heavy price as a result of the same policy .& rdquo ;
Rouhi Fattouh , a senior official with the ruling Fatah faction , on Thursday condemned the & ldquo ; crimes & rdquo ; of Israel in the Negev . Fattouh accused Israel of working towards expelling the Bedouin from the Negev and seizing their lands .
& ldquo ; Our Palestinian people everywhere stand with our people in the Negev and support their steadfastness ,& rdquo ; he said .
The PLO & rsquo ; s Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) also likened the Israeli measures in the Negev to the ongoing tensions between the Palestinians , IDF soldiers and settlers in the West Bank .
The PFLP praised the Bedouin citizens for & ldquo ; rising up in rejection of [ Israel & rsquo ; s ] decision to confiscate their lands in favor of settlement projects .& rdquo ;
The PFLP called for & ldquo ; uniting all efforts to confront this new project , which is a repetition of what happened with our people in Khan al - Ahmar .& rdquo ;
KHAN AL - AHMAR is a Bedouin village located near Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim . In 2018 , the High Court of Justice ruled that the village can be evicted because it was illegally constructed , a move that triggered a crisis and international outcry and resulted in the postponement of the demolition .
The PFLP called for a & ldquo ; heroic response & rdquo ; of the Bedouin citizens in the Negev to Israel & rsquo ; s alleged plan to seize their lands . It also called on the Bedouin citizens not to serve in the IDF .
& ldquo ; We call on the masses of our people to mobilize and participate widely in the demonstrations of anger that will start today [ Thursday ] and tomorrow [ Friday ] in the villages and towns of the occupied Negev ,& rdquo ; the PFLP said .
Maher Mezher , member of the PFLP Politburo , said what is happening in the Negev is in the context of the & ldquo ; clash between all Palestinians and the occupation .& rdquo ;
Mezher told the Palestinian Quds Network website the Israeli & ldquo ; crimes in the Negev are a continuation of the frenzied onslaught of settlements and Judaization in Jerusalem and the West Bank , in addition to the siege of the Gaza Strip .& rdquo ;
Hamas also accused Israel of seeking to & ldquo ; Judaize & rdquo ; the Negev .
& ldquo ; The increase in Zionist policies to confiscate Palestinian lands through the so - called Jewish National Fund confirms once again that the policy of ethnic cleansing launched by the Zionist movement still governs the mentality of the Zionist entity ,& rdquo ; said Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem .
He too urged the Bedouin in the Negev to step up their protests & ldquo ; to consolidate the Arab - Palestinian identity of the occupied territories .& rdquo ;
Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) official Ahmed al - Mudalal said the Bedouin in the Negev and the Palestinians in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem are in a & ldquo ; state of confrontation with the occupation .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; What is happening in the Negev is a crime against our people ,& rdquo ; the PIJ official said . & ldquo ; The Zionist enemy is committing the crime of ethnic cleansing against our people in the occupied Negev and trying to impose its Zionist agenda on all the Palestinian lands .& rdquo ;
Mudalal claimed that the & ldquo ; victory achieved by the Palestinian resistance & rdquo ; during last year & rsquo ; s war between Israel and Hamas & ldquo ; restored unity to the Palestinian people in all places of their existence .& rdquo ;
PIJ spokesperson Tareq Ezz al - Din said there was & ldquo ; no difference & rdquo ; between the Negev , Jerusalem and the West Bank .
& ldquo ; What is happening in the Negev is happening in [ the east Jerusalem neighborhood of ] Sheikh Jarrah and [ the West Bank village of ] Beita ,& rdquo ; Ezz al - Din told Quds Network . & ldquo ; The Palestinian factions and people must escalate the resistance in all its forms , first and foremost the armed struggle [ against Israel ].& rdquo ;
