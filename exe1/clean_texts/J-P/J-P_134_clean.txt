A Hezbollah missile hits an IAF fighter jet . In response , the entire air force is scrambled to participate in a broad offensive against Lebanon , including attacks against infrastructure such as bridges , power plants and airports spanning 24 hours . That scenario was the focus of an IDF exercise that began on Sunday morning and ended on Tuesday at noon .


& nbsp ;

During the drill , the IAF proved its ability to strike at 3 , 000 Hezbollah targets within a 24 - hour period .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We practiced defending Israel & rsquo ; s skies against cruise missiles and operating our active [ aerial ] defense system against the rockets that they will want to use to target air force bases and densely populated areas ,& rdquo ; a senior IAF officer said .



& nbsp ;


& ldquo ; We practiced attacking high - value targets in quantities in a way we never did before ,& rdquo ; the officer added . & ldquo ; It was 24 hours with more than 3 , 000 targets attacked , causing severe damage to the operations of the enemy .& rdquo ;

& nbsp ;

& nbsp ;

Despite the limitations imposed by the coronavirus crisis , about 85 % of IAF personnel participated in the exercise , which involved all branches , including technicians , ammunition officers and reservists , who were called up to participate .
& nbsp ;

& nbsp ;

One of the main tasks simulated was achieving air superiority over Lebanon . This was achieved by destroying all elements that could threaten Israeli aircraft , including antiaircraft launchers , especially in southern Lebanon and Beirut , where Hezbollah has its headquarters .
& nbsp ;
Two weeks ago , Hezbollah tried to shoot down an IAF drone over Lebanon . The surface - to - air missile missed , and the drone continued its reconnaissance mission , the IDF said at the time .
& nbsp ;
While the drill focused on Hezbollah and Lebanon , the IAF considers the North as a single front and understands that Hezbollah also operates in Syria and that Iran is present throughout what is referred to as the & ldquo ; Shi & rsquo ; ite Crescent ,& rdquo ; spanning Iran , Iraq , Syria and Lebanon , the senior officer said .



& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We look even further east , but we operate there only in response to [ incidents ],& rdquo ; he said .
& nbsp ;
Lt .- Col . S ., commander of the 201st Squadron that flies the F - 16I and participated in the drill , told The Jerusalem Post his unit practiced a wide range of missions , including collecting intelligence and using many types of munitions in attacking multiple targets .


& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; This drill demonstrated a response to a mistake the other side made ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; It shows the enemy what the air force will do in response to an attack on a fighter jet .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
During the 60 hours of the exercise , the entire staff of the squadron , including pilots and technicians , practiced loading and unloading different types of munitions onto and off of their fighter jets , all of which participated in the drill , S . said .


& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re talking here about lifting munitions weighing tons ... We basically did everything we will do in a war , except actually flying to the operational area , and dropping the bombs ,& rdquo ; he said .


& nbsp ;
Another aspect of the exercise was getting the participants into the mood of the drill and hoping that reservists , who are considered a vital element in the air force , drop their day - to - day lives and attend .


& nbsp ;

& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; On Sunday morning we got the call that the drill is starting ,& rdquo ; S . said . & ldquo ; It caught us by surprise . We changed all our plans and started operating in war mode .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; People who planned to be with their loved ones on Valentine & rsquo ; s Day had to cancel the plans ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; Our reservists who planned on going to work on Sunday and Monday had to call their bosses or their colleagues and tell them they couldn & rsquo ; t come .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; But above all , it was a mental exercise ,& rdquo ; S . said . & ldquo ; Just after the lockdown and the uncertainty , people understood that this is what they have to do , and they attended the drill .& rdquo ;
