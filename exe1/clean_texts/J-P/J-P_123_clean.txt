A Bulgarian prosecutor provided detailed evidence to the Bulgarian court handling Hezbollah & rsquo ; s involvement in the 2012 Burgas bus bombing which killed five Israelis and their Bulgarian - Muslim bus driver , but the court refused to accept it , The Jerusalem Post has learned .
& nbsp ;
Despite an official court transcript of these details and an appeal by the Israeli victims & rsquo ; lawyer Yaki Rand to convince the Bulgarian appeals court to issue convictions , including terrorism charges against Hezbollah , the Post also understands there is a high chance that Bulgaria & rsquo ; s judiciary is looking to put the case to bed .
& nbsp ;
Throughout the trial there was a dispute about Bulgarian officials allegedly trying to charge only the individuals , while seeking to avoid angering Hezbollah by naming it in the case .
& nbsp ;
For years , Bulgarian prosecutors claimed that they had no evidence with which to tie the two defendants , who were eventually given life sentences in absentia , directly to Hezbollah and terrorism .
& nbsp ;
Yet , on September 17 , 2020 , after the full trial and conviction and only four days before the sentencing hearing , the prosecutor finally admitted on the record that there was significant evidence on the issue .
& nbsp ;
The prosecutor proceeded to detail the evidence into the court record , but since the conviction had already been set , the Bulgarian trial court said its hands were tied and that it could not reopen the case to charge Hezbollah and add terrorism charges .
& nbsp ;
Rand has asked the Bulgarian appeals court to order the case reopened in order to add the new charge raised by the prosecutors & rsquo ; late additional comments , but there are indications that the judiciary wants to be done with the case .
& nbsp ;
It is highly unusual for prosecutors to raise new facts and charges post - conviction , and it is still unclear why the prosecutor did not raise the evidence during the trial itself .
& nbsp ;
The case shook Europe to its foundations for its audacity , but left the families of the victims and Israel partially unsatisfied because Hezbollah itself was not formally indicted or convicted .
& nbsp ;
At a July 2019 anniversary ceremony for the victims , their families had demanded that Hezbollah itself be charged in the Bulgarian trial for committing an act of terrorism .
& nbsp ;
In his speech , Kobi Price , one of the family members , noted that , & ldquo ; three years ago & hellip ; four years after the attack , the criminal trial opened & hellip ; In the indictment & hellip ; only two attackers & rdquo ; were charged .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We , the mourning families , ask the Government of Bulgaria to rise above narrow political considerations and to add the terror organization Hezbollah to the indictment without delay ,& rdquo ; said Price .
& nbsp ;
Price continued , & ldquo ; Without Hezbollah , there is no morality in the trial . Without Hezbollah , the trial is ineffective . Without Hezbollah , there is no justice for the murdered victims .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
He reiterated to the Post on Monday that it was unclear how much deterrence or justice could be achieved against the attackers if Hezbollah as an organization is left untouched .
& nbsp ;
In January 2018 , the Post exclusively disclosed that the Bulgarian state prosecution had decided not to charge Hezbollah as an organization with involvement in the 2012 bomb attack at the Burgas airport .
& nbsp ;
Instead , the prosecutor indicted the two men allegedly involved in the attack as if they were terrorists or even regular criminals who acted without connection to an organization . The word & ldquo ; Hezbollah & rdquo ; does not appear in the indictment .
& nbsp ;
In addition , the indictment did not mention standard terrorism offenses such as & ldquo ; acting as part of a terrorist organization & rdquo ; or connecting the murder offense to terrorism , referring instead merely to disturbing public order .
& nbsp ;
Sources close to the case told the Post at the time that when the Bulgarian prosecutor was confronted with these anomalies , he claimed that no one provided him with evidence demonstrating Hezbollah & rsquo ; s involvement .
& nbsp ;
This directly contradicted evidence that came to light immediately after the attack from Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov naming Hezbollah as the culprit .
& nbsp ;
In 2013 , Tsvetanov & rsquo ; s successor , Tsvetlin Yovchev , told reporters before a commemoration ceremony , & ldquo ; There are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Also in 2013 , then - Bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both confirmed the solid evidence linking Hezbollah to the Burgas attack .
& nbsp ;
Bulgaria & rsquo ; s investigation into the Burgas bombing even led to the EU placing Hezbollah & rsquo ; s armed wing on its blacklist .
& nbsp ;
The ruling party in Bulgaria has changed numerous times since 2012 with some observers saying politics ham - strung the trial .
& nbsp ;
Toby Dershowitz , senior vice president for government relations and Strategy at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a nonpartisan think tank focused on national security , told the Post at the time of sentencing that & ldquo ; Bulgaria has long known that Hezbollah was behind this horrific attack and has been clear about it . The fact that Bulgaria says it only has a mechanism to prosecute individuals , and not organizations , should not permit Hezbollah to yet again murder with impunity .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Post previously reported that Bulgaria sent extradition orders to Lebanon & rsquo ; s government regarding the two Hezbollah operatives who were then charged with the act of terrorism .
& nbsp ;
The Lebanese - Australian Meliad Farah and Lebanese - Canadian Hassan El Hajj Hassan , who have been convicted of blowing up the tour bus in Burgas , Bulgaria , are believed to be in Lebanon .
& nbsp ;
There are also US court documents from other terror and Hezbollah - related cases which have confirmed that the two convicted men as well as the third attacker who died in the attack , French - Lebanese national Jacques Felipe Martin ( aka Mohammad Hassan el - Husseini ), were connected to Hezbollah .
& nbsp ;
According to media reports , the two convicted murderers are alleged to have entered Bulgaria using false drivers & rsquo ; licenses printed in Lebanon .

The Post sent press queries to Bulgaria @@@ s embassy and foreign ministry on Tuesday evening .
