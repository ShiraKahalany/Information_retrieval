The status quo in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is unsustainable , Jordan & rsquo ; s King Abdullah told the UN General Assembly , as he called for a two - state resolution to the conflict .
& ldquo ; How many more children will die before the world wakes up ?& rdquo ; Abdullah said on Wednesday in a pre - recorded message played at the opening session of the 76th UNGA in New York .

US President Joe Biden spoke to the UNGA on Tuesday of his support for a two - state resolution to the conflict , but said that & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; re a long way from that goal at the moment .& rdquo ;
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett , who is expected to address the forum next week , has said bluntly that he does not support Palestinian statehood and has no intention to enter into negotiations for such a resolution .
Jordan , Egypt and the Palestinian Authority have pushed back at the idea of putting a resolution to the conflict on the back burner , warning that this would be a mistake .
& ldquo ; The bitter war on Gaza this past year was a reminder that the current situation is simply unsustainable ,& rdquo ; King Abdullah said . & ldquo ; Genuine security for either side & ndash ; indeed , for the whole world & ndash ; can only be achieved through the two - step solution , a solution that leads to the establishment of an independent , sovereign , and viable Palestinian state on the basis of the June 1967 lines , with east Jerusalem as its & nbsp ; capital , living side - by - side with Israel in peace and security .& rdquo ;
Abdullah also referenced his country & rsquo ; s special connection as the custodian of the city & rsquo ; s Islamic and Christian sites .
He told the GA that the time had come for Jerusalem to unite rather than divide the three monotheistic religions .
& ldquo ; I believe Jerusalem & rsquo ; s holiness to Muslims , Christians and Jews can and must bring us together ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; With international help , the holy city can be , not a cause of division , but a symbol of unity for all to see .& rdquo ;
Jordan , along with the PA , has been concerned that Israel wants to change the status quo understanding with regard to those sites , particularly with respect to the Temple Mount .
An arrangement put in place after the 1967 Six Day War has allowed only for Muslims to worship at the site , which is the holiest site in Judaism . The Israeli Right has increasingly pushed back at that arrangement , and informal Jewish prayer does occur on the Temple Mount .
