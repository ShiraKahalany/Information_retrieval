In the midst of horror , stories of heroism emerge . Linoy Al - Ezra , a resident of Hatzor HaGlilit and a senior Magen David Adom medic , started her shift on the fateful morning of the deadly Hamas terrorist attack in the south of the country . In a heart - wrenching conversation , she spoke with nine - year - old Michael , a resident of a Kfar Aza , who informed her that his parents had been shot and were unresponsive . Michael was only nine years old , his sister age 6 " In an attempt to assess if there was any hope of saving them , I asked him where they had been shot . From his description , it became evident that there was no chance of saving them ," she recalls , sharing in the pain . " Michael remained composed and performed admirably , telling me that he was with his six - year - old sister named Alma ." Al - Ezra went on to describe how she guided them to safety , saying , " I advised them to go to the shelter and lock the door securely . He initially hesitated but then complied . I inquired if there was a closet inside the shelter , and he confirmed its presence . I instructed them to enter the closet , remain quiet , and not come out until the brave soldiers arrived to rescue them ." In a recent meeting with their aunt and grandmother , Al - Ezra shared their story of bravery . For many hours , these two young souls remained hidden in a closet , maintaining their silence , ultimately ensuring their survival . The Jerusalem Post and OneFamily are working together to help support the victims of the Hamas massacre and the soldiers of Israel who have been drafted to ensure that it never happens again .
