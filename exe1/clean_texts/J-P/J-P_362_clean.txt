National Missions Minister Orit Struk spoke this Sunday on 104 . 5FM radio about the two choices facing the Israeli government : A hostage deal or entering Rafah . In Strock ' s remarks , she sharply criticized the US , claiming that it is " not worthy to be called a friend of Israel ." At the beginning of the conversation , Strock stated , " I am very worried this morning , thinking that things were almost put on the table and that the US is committed to stopping the war . And I mean in the most explicit and clear way ; the first stage from the US perspective is a ceasefire ." Strock ' s controversial views on both US and Israeli governmentStrock continued , " The State of Israel is not another star in the flag of the US . It can and must stand on its own . The US is not worthy of being called a friend of the State of Israel ." Strock stirred controversy last week when she said , " A government that sends hundreds of thousands of people to fight for a specific goal and actually throws the goals of the war into the trash in order to release 22 or 33 , while most of the captives remain in Gaza with no chance of release except by stopping the war , has no right to exist ."
