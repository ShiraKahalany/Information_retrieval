The Justice Ministry published on Wednesday the list of prisoners to be released as part of the expected deal with Hamas . Prisoners to be released come from groups such as Hamas , Palestinian Islamic Jihad , Fatah , and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ). Most of the prisoners have a blue ID card , meaning that they live in east Jerusalem ( as opposed to Gaza or the West Bank , whose residents have green ones ), but they are not Israeli citizens . Those to be released were tried in military and civilian courts alike , according to media . Only 150 of the expected 300 prisoners are expected to be released in the first stage of the deal , according to Hebrew media , adding that more prisoners from the published list will be released upon the further release of hostages . The majority of prisoners to be released , though not all , are under the age of 18 or are women , according to the 15 - page list . & nbsp ; Who are some of the prisoners expected to be released ? One prisoner to be released is Ahmed Marzouk , 18 , arrested four months ago for assaulting police , arson , possession of weapons , and other charges . Another is Amani Heshim , 37 , arrested in December 2016 and charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm , armed with knives and daggers . Walela Khaled Fozi Tangi , 26 , arrested in August last year was charged with attempted murder and possession of weapons and explosives . The Knesset approved the outline of the deal by a large majority on Tuesday night . An Israeli hostage will be released for every three Palestinian prisoners released by Israel & ndash ; 50 women and children hostages for 150 Palestinian prisoners over four days , starting Thursday .
