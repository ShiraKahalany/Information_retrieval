The Na Laga & rsquo ; at ( Please Touch ) Center , a non - profit arts and cultural center in Jaffa that has created a & nbsp ; meeting place for deaf , blind and deaf - blind individuals as well as the general public , is presenting a & nbsp ; special program called Blind Day , from June 4 - 6 . The center , which includes a theater , a restaurant , an event complex and a workshop , is holding this event & nbsp ; with the slogan , & ldquo ; Close your eyes & ndash ; and see !& rdquo ; The idea is to hold activities and events that are staged in ways that mimic blindness , so people without & nbsp ; visual challenges can experience aspects of what blind people go through . Among the events will be the center & rsquo ; s flagship production , & ldquo ; Not on Bread Alone ,& rdquo ; which features 11 deaf - blind & nbsp ; actors who take the audience on a journey in their unique world , mixing the realms of darkness , silence , and & nbsp ; baking bread . The show is based around the process of kneading the dough , letting it rise , and baking it on & nbsp ; stage . The ensemble rehearsed this production for two years before bringing it to the stage , and it presents a & nbsp ; unique sensory experience , demonstrating different ways of communication . An evening in their shoes & ldquo ; Conversations with the Bartender & rdquo ; is a successful cult show that is held in a completely dark room , in which & nbsp ; the audience sits together with the actors at the bar in the Na Laga & rsquo ; at restaurant in complete darkness ,& nbsp ; drinking , talking , laughing , and listening to music . The Blackout Restaurant at the Center will host Chef Yehuda Amar . Amar is a Master Chef winner , and currently & nbsp ; the chef of the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel as well as for the Israeli national soccer team . The meal he will create & nbsp ; consists of a set menu that will be made especially for the evening . The chef has a personal connection with the place , which will be revealed at the end of the four - course meal . Dietary restrictions can be accommodated , and the restaurant is kosher dairy , with certification from the Tel Aviv Rabbinate .& ldquo ; The Blind Day at the Na Laga & rsquo ; at Center emphasizes and focuses the work we do all year at the center of & nbsp ; raising awareness of people with sensory disabilities through cultural events for the general public & nbsp ; throughout the year ,& rdquo ; CEO Oren Itzhaki said .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; Throughout the program , there are unique activities , featuring a welcome collaboration between artists from & nbsp ; different fields .
