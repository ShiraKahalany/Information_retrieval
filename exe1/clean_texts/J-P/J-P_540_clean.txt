Only 40 % of Israelis support a two - state resolution to the conflict with the Palestinians , even though it remains the most popular choice , according to a poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute .
& nbsp ;
Past IDI polls on this question have shown that Israeli support for two states has fluctuated widely over the past 28 years since the signing of the 1993 Oslo I Accord in Washington .
& nbsp ;
Past polls on this topic by IDI show that support for a two - state resolution peaked at 70 % in 2007 during the Annapolis peace process brokered by former president George W . Bush between former prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
& nbsp ;
It was at its lowest point in 1995 with only 36 . 9 % support , based on IDI data .
& nbsp ;
From July 27 to 29 , the IDI polled 750 Israelis over the age of 18 by phone and over the Internet , including 151 Arabic - speakers . The margin of error is 3 . 59 % for the poll on a wide array of topics , including the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
& nbsp ;
Participants were asked if they would back a & ldquo ; two - state solution with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Israeli - Arabs were much more likely to support a two - state resolution than their Jewish peers .
& nbsp ;
Out of the 39 . 7 % who said they found such a resolution to the conflict acceptable , 33 . 8 % were Jewish Israelis and 68 . 8 % were Israeli - Arabs .
& nbsp ;
That answer flipped when it came to the 48 % of Israelis who opposed it , of which 53 . 6 % were Jewish and 20 . 5 % Arab .
& nbsp ;
The poll was conducted in the absence of any peace process , with the United States and Israel appearing to prefer maintaining the status quo for the moment .
& nbsp ;
According to the IDI poll , out of the 37 . 1 % of Israelis who support maintenance of the status quo , 41 . 5 % were Jewish - Israelis and 15 . 4 % were Israeli - Arabs .
& nbsp ;
Similarly , Israeli - Arabs were more likely to oppose the status quo , with 69 . 5 % finding it unacceptable compared to the 37 . 2 % of Israeli Jews finding it acceptable . Overall , 42 . 6 % of those polled disapproved of the status quo .
& nbsp ;
The least popular option was a one - state idea . Participants were asked whether they would back a & ldquo ; one - state solution incorporating both Israeli and Palestinian territories in which Israelis and Palestinians are treated as equal citizens ,& rdquo ; implying a country that was no longer intended to be an ethnic nationalist democracy for either Israelis or Palestinians .
& nbsp ;
That idea received only 21 . 1 % support among Israelis and 64 . 2 % opposition . Some 71 . 1 % of Israeli Jews found a one - state idea unacceptable , and only 14 . 1 % found it acceptable .
& nbsp ;
A majority of Israeli - Arabs favored it , with 56 . 1 % backing it , compared to the 29 . 5 % who dismissed it .
& nbsp ;
The poll was conducted within the context of the Israeli Voice Index published by the Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research .
& nbsp ;
IDI researcher Or Anabi clarified that while there is a drop in support for the two - state solution , it is hard to look at it comparatively over time , because IDI often asks the question in different ways , which impacts the results .
& nbsp ;
It is also possible that the lack of support could correlate to the absence of a peace process , Anabi explained .
& nbsp ;
People respond differently to concrete events as opposed to theoretical ones , he said . Initial polls showed low support for a Sinai withdrawal , Anabi said , but the moment former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat landed in Israel , the attitudes changed .
