Full - time wages for young ultra - Orthodox men with no secondary education are 16 % lower than for their non - haredi Jewish counterparts , according to a study by the Finance Ministry & rsquo ; s Chief Economist office . The study examined the quality of the haredi school system for boys and found indications that this education system was not as effective as the non - ultra - Orthodox system in preparing students for the workforce . In addition to finding the gap in wages , which was based on data from 2019 , and was a gap of around NIS 1350 , the study found that only 43 % of students who graduated from the ultra - Orthodox school system were able to complete an academic degree within six years of starting one . This number is 65 % for their Jewish non - haredi counterparts , according to the study . Although the gap in completing education may have many factors , both findings indicate that the skills taught by the haredi school system are not as suited for the labor force as those taught in non - haredi education tracks , said the report . Haredi school systems do not prepare students for higher - quality positionsThe finding about completing an academic degree also indicates that the haredi school system does not prepare haredi students to integrate into higher quality positions , said the report . Closing labor market gaps between ultra - Orthodox and non - ultra Orthodox men is important for the long - term growth of Israel & rsquo ; s economy , and increasing core - curriculum subjects taught in the ultra - Orthodox system is one way to close the gap , the report concluded .& nbsp ;
