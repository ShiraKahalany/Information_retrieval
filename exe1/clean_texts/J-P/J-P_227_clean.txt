World Jewish Congress president Ronald S . Lauder praised the ceasefire reached between Israel and Hamas , ending 11 days of conflict .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; On behalf of the more than 100 Jewish communities across the globe affiliated with the World Jewish Congress , I welcome the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas after more than 11 days of violence and bloodshed caused by Hamas & rsquo ; terrorist barrage of rocket attacks aimed at Israel & rsquo ; s civilian population ,& quot ; Lauder said in a statement .
& nbsp ;
Lauder also gave praise to multiple world leaders and political figures who voiced their support of Israel during the conflict , as it saw thousands of rockets fired into its territory from the Gaza Strip .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We stand resolutely and unambiguously with Israel and express our deep appreciation to US President Joe Biden and other world leaders for their repeated recognition of Israel & rsquo ; s absolute right to defend itself against terrorist onslaught , in whatever form it may come ,& quot ; he said .
& nbsp ;
Lauder also discussed the numerous casualties in both Israel and Gaza due to the fighting that was & quot ; a result of Hamas hatred and disregard for the sanctity of human life ,& quot ; and urged for Israel and the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table to work towards a two - state solution .
& nbsp ;
The ceasefire , mediated by Egypt , has seen a cessation of overt hostilities between Israel and the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip since it was implemented early Friday morning . However , there has been a notable upsurge of antisemitic incidents worldwide since the conflict began , and even as the ceasefire was put into place .
& nbsp ;
Referencing this , Lauder said that & quot ; we condemn in the strongest possible terms the horrendous outbreaks of antisemitic manifestations in the wake of the Israel - Hamas conflict , with anti - Israel demonstrators targeting synagogues and Jewish community centers , and seeking to blame Jews around the world for the latest Middle East violence .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
He added that : & quot ; We are also outraged by the surge of virulently antisemitic hate speech across social media with posts on major platforms featuring Holocaust imagery , conspiracy myths and Nazi glorification .
& nbsp ;
& quot ; I call on governments and authorities everywhere to take all necessary measures to protect all Jewish communities , Jewish institutions and individual Jews . And I call on social media organizations to immediately rid their platforms of vile posts that promote violence against Jews with such vile declarations as , & lsquo ; Hitler was right ,& rsquo ;& quot ; he concluded .
