Israel should put forward its own ceasefire plan calling for the exile of Hamas leadership and military wing in exchange for the release of the hostages , United Right Party leader Gideon Sa & rsquo ; ar told The Jerusalem Post as he laid out three mistakes Israel has made in conducting the Gaza war .& ldquo ; We always return to the same ineffective ideas wrapped in bombastic statements that won & rsquo ; t lead to victory . The time has come for new ideas ,& rdquo ; he said . The veteran politician , who is a fierce opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , quit the government this week , after making a failed bid to be included in the war cabinet . He had entered the government together with the National Unity Party at the start of the war to make a difference , but once he understood that was not possible , he left , in a move that was symbolic of the political turmoil , but which barely dented the coalition & rsquo ; s governing capacity , bringing it down from 76 to 72 seats .& ldquo ; We are stuck in every direction . We are stuck in Gaza . We are stuck on the Lebanese border . We are stuck with the hostages , and we are stuck in the international arena ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar explained , as he sat in his office in the Knesset wearing a suit and tie . He arrived late to the interview due to a vote in the plenum and left in the middle to participate in a second vote . He spoke in a week of high tension between Israel and the United States and amid increased international pressure on Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire , and if not , to at least pause hostilities until the end of Ramadan on April 9 .& ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s clear that the world wants [ Israel ] to end the war . It & rsquo ; s clear that the US administration , for all kinds of reasons , wants the war to be over . So Israel has to stand [ alone ] against everyone .& ldquo ; But you can minimize the dispute with a better handling of the issues that cause us problems and with [ the initiation of ] more proactive policies ,& rdquo ; he stated . Three errors Israel should correct in GazaSA & rsquo ; AR FOCUSED on three errors Israel should correct in Gaza , now that the war sparked by Hamas & rsquo ; s invasion of Israel on October 7 will soon hit the half - year mark . The first , he said , he put on the table already in October . He called for the & ldquo ; surrender and exile of the Hamas military wing and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Gaza to countries friendly to them : Syria , Turkey , Qatar , and Iran .& rdquo ; The hostages would be freed in conjunction , and the deal could also include an Israeli agreement to release some Palestinian security prisoners and terrorists , he said . The framing of the idea , he said , should be that it is Israel & rsquo ; s ceasefire proposal , rather than perpetually being in the position of appearing to object to a halt to the war . It also works as an answer to the international objections to Israel & rsquo ; s pending military operation in Rafah to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions . The & ldquo ; argument against it would be that Hamas won & rsquo ; t agree to it . That is probably correct ,& rdquo ; he said , & ldquo ; at least not at this moment .& ldquo ; But at least we can tell the world and say , & lsquo ; We want to enter Rafah , but we do not have to .& rsquo ; If this [ Hamas surrender and exile plan ] happens , then we can end the war . You say you want a ceasefire . You want to end Hamas & rsquo ; s governance [ of Gaza ]. Well , here is a pragmatic idea that also ends the humanitarian suffering caused by the war ,& rdquo ; he stated . This framing helps put the onus on Hamas for the failure to achieve a ceasefire , he explained .& ldquo ; It gives us more legitimization with our friends , and then , if there are no other options ,& rdquo ; Israel can explain that it has to finish the war because Hamas won & rsquo ; t agree to end it , Sa & rsquo ; ar said . His second issue dealt with the failures around the delivery of humanitarian assistance , for which Israel did not provide options effectively and quickly enough . Sa & rsquo ; ar spoke amid a bitter dispute between Israel and the international community on the issue of humanitarian assistance , with the United Nations and the European Union accusing Israel of creating starvation conditions in Gaza . Israel has said that more than enough aid enters Gaza , but that the UN and international organizations have failed to properly distribute it . The army should have seized control of the situation from the start and created a humanitarian administration to ensure the distribution of food and the provision of water and basic sanitation , Sa & rsquo ; ar said . The international community would still provide the aid and be involved , but the army would have oversight to make sure that delivery is successful .& ldquo ; I know the army doesn & rsquo ; t love this ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said , acknowledging that there are some risks with the plan , which could lead to increased friction between the IDF and Palestinian civilians in Gaza . It & rsquo ; s a plan that also tackles some of the governance vacuum created by the IDF & rsquo ; s military campaign against Hamas , which partially but not completely eliminated the terrorist group & rsquo ; s forced rule of the enclave . Until Hamas is destroyed , there can & rsquo ; t be an alternative government in Gaza , Sa & rsquo ; ar said , adding that IDF control of the distribution of basic services , in partnership with international organizations , is the only smart option that can prevent the terrorist group & rsquo ; s return . If the IDF had taken charge of issues of food , water , medicine , and sanitation , Israel would have a better & ldquo ; standing in the international community ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar stressed . His third point , Sa & rsquo ; ar said , is that the war has to proceed at a quicker pace for the sake of Israel & rsquo ; s economy , its international standing , and the looming threat of an all - out war with Hezbollah in the north .& ldquo ; We have always known that we needed to wage the war as quickly as possible ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; It is hard for us to wage long - term wars .& rdquo ; Some thought that the international community would lose interest in the war as time went on , Sa & rsquo ; ar explained , adding that he always believed Israel had a tight timeline for the war .& ldquo ; It was clear from the start that this idea was mistaken . We can & rsquo ; t drag on the war forever ,& rdquo ; he said .& ldquo ; As long as you haven & rsquo ; t ended the Gaza war , you can & rsquo ; t deal with Hezbollah ,& rdquo ; he added . Hezbollah has to withdraw from the border , he said , as he referenced diplomatic efforts to ensure that it complies with Resolution 1701 , which set out the ceasefire terms that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006 . Only then can the residents in communities along that border , who were evacuated at the start of the Gaza war when violence broke out simultaneously with Lebanon , return home . In the end , they will return home . & ldquo ; It has to happen ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar stressed , but that he hopes Israel will do it through diplomacy and not through a full - scale war . Sa ' ar : A Palestinian state is a danger to IsraelSA & rsquo ; AR , WHO began his political life in the Likud in 2003 , and formed his own party , initially called New Hope , in 2020 , does not disagree with all of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s policies . He has always been opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state , even more so now in the aftermath of October 7 .& ldquo ; A Palestinian state is a danger to Israel , to its security , and it is not a & lsquo ; maybe & rsquo ; danger ; it & rsquo ; s a clear danger . The creation of a Palestinian state would allow them to continue their war to destroy Israel from an improved position .& rdquo ; It would & ldquo ; strengthen those Palestinian forces who believe that war brings results .& rdquo ; Israel has to work to prevent Palestinian statehood , he said . It can take a positive stance on other issues regarding the Palestinians , but it can & rsquo ; t allow itself to go in this direction . Should the Palestinian Authority be reformed , such that it stops its monthly payments to terrorists jailed by Israel and the incitement in its education system , then it could be possible to advance in certain areas , he said . Sa & rsquo ; ar said he stands with Netanyahu in opposing the return of the PA to Gaza . He has also supported many of the stances Netanyahu has taken in the international arena , including in his relationship with the United States .& ldquo ; Netanyahu is acting to preserve Israel & rsquo ; s international interests in this war , and in most of the situations when he fought with the US , I thought he was right ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar explained .& ldquo ; Historically , prime ministers have been at odds with supportive US presidents during a war ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said , as he recalled the diplomatic battles between former prime minister Menachem Begin and former US president Ronald Reagan during the First Lebanon War . He pointed to the most recent battle between Jerusalem and Washington over the Biden administration & rsquo ; s failure on Monday to veto a UN Security Council resolution that called for a temporary pause to the war , without tying it to the release of any of the remaining 134 hostages in Gaza . Before the UNSC vote , Netanyahu threatened that if the US didn & rsquo ; t use its veto , he wouldn & rsquo ; t send a high - level delegation to Washington for a scheduled meeting . After the vote , Netanyahu held to his word but has since backed down and is looking to dispatch the delegation to the US next week . It was a mistake for Netanyahu to attempt to back the US into a corner , and it didn & rsquo ; t increase the chances of a veto , Sa & rsquo ; ar said . Netanyahu should have kept his objections private , but essentially he was correct that the vote was bad for Israel , Sa & rsquo ; ar said . The issue here is one of style , he explained . Netanyahu has & ldquo ; to know how to stand strong with friends , but to do it when it is essential , and to do it in a respectful way ,& rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said . He himself has a long history of standing on principle and was one of the group of what was known as the & ldquo ; Likud rebels & rdquo ; who opposed former prime minister Ariel Sharon & rsquo ; s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the destruction of the 21 settlements there . Sa & rsquo ; ar recalled how he had argued with former foreign minister Tzipi Livni , who was then in Sharon & rsquo ; s government , about the Disengagement . She had contended that the withdrawal would legitimize Israel & rsquo ; s right to self - defense against the Palestinians , Sa & rsquo ; ar recalled . He had disputed that . History has shown , Sa & rsquo ; ar said , that & ldquo ; I was correct .& rdquo ;
