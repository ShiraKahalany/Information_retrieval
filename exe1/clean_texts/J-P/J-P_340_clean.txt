Israel acquiesced on Wednesday to US demands that it won & rsquo ; t stop basic humanitarian aid such as food , water and medicine from entering the Gaza Strip through Egypt & rsquo ; s Rafah Crossing .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; In light of President Biden ' s request , Israel will not prevent humanitarian assistance from Egypt as long as it is only food , water and medicine for the civilian population located in the southern Gaza Strip ,& rdquo ; the Prime Minster & rsquo ; s Office said at the end of Biden & rsquo ; s visit one day solidarity visit to Tel Aviv . It warned , however , that it would only allow these supplies in , as long as it did not reach Hamas .& ldquo ; Any supplies that reach Hamas & ndash ; will be prevented ,& rdquo ; the PMO stated . The war cabinet took this step , it explained , & ldquo ; In light of the sweeping and vital American support for the war effort , as well as US President Biden ' s request for basic humanitarian assistance .& rdquo ; Assistance in the interimThe PMO stressed , however , that it could not provide assistance to the Palestinians as long as Hamas was holding over 200 people hostage .& ldquo ; Israel will not allow any humanitarian aid from its territory to the Gaza Strip as long as the hostages are not returned ,& rdquo ; the PMO said .& ldquo ; Israel demands that the Red Cross visits to the captives and is working to mobilize extensive international support for this demand ,& rdquo ; the PMO said . Biden arrived in Israel on the 12th day of the Gaza war , which began when Hamas assaulted southern Israel on October 7th , killing over 1 , 400 civilians and soldiers and taking an additional 200 people captive .& nbsp ; He spent the better part of the visit promoting his support for Israel , but he also underscored his commitment to the Palestinian people and announced a $ 100 million humanitarian aid package for Gaza and the West Bank .& ldquo ; This money will support more than 1 million displaced and conflict - affected Palestinians , including emergency needs in Gaza ,& rdquo ; he said . Israeli aerial strikes as well as failed Palestinian rocket launches , however , have claimed some 3 , 500 Palestinian lives .& nbsp ; Some one million Palestinians , out of the 2 . 3 million that live in the Strip , have fled their homes in northern Gaza to escape the bombings .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas . & nbsp ; Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people ,& rdquo ; US President Joe BidenIsrael & rsquo ; s decision to stop the flow of food , fuel and electricity from Israel into Gaza , however , has created a humanitarian crisis . During Biden & rsquo ; s trip , Netanyahu assured the President that & ldquo ; During this war Israel will do everything it can to keep civilians out of harm & rsquo ; s way . We have asked them and will continue to ask them to move to safer areas .& ldquo ; We will continue to work with you to ensure that the minimal requirements are met ,& rdquo ; he said . Biden said that it was important not to confuse Palestinians in Gaza with ISIS like Hamas terrorists who brutally killed Israelis , in some cases burning them alive .& ldquo ; The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas . & nbsp ; Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people ,& rdquo ; Biden said .& ldquo ; Hamas uses innocents & mdash ; innocent families in Gaza as human shields , putting their command centers , their weapons , their communications tunnels in residential areas ,& rdquo ; Biden explained . He understood , Biden said , that for Israel the was reminiscent of the Holocaust and was larger in scope for Israel than the September 11th attack in 2001 against the Twin Towers .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; For a nation the size of Israel , it was like 15 9 / 11s . & nbsp ; The scale may be different , but I & rsquo ; m sure those horrors have tapped into so - & mdash ; some kind of primal feeling in Israel , just like it did and felt in the United States ,& rdquo ; Biden said .& ldquo ; Shock , pain , rage & mdash ; an all - consuming rage . I understand , and many Americans understand ,& rdquo ; he said .& nbsp ; But he cautioned , & ldquo ; While you feel that rage , don & rsquo ; t be consumed by it .& rdquo ; Israel has an obligation as a Jewish state and a democracy to value human life , he said .& ldquo ; You are a Jewish state , but you & rsquo ; re also a democracy . & nbsp ; And like the United States , you don & rsquo ; t live by the rules of terrorists . & nbsp ; You live by the rule of law . & nbsp ; And when conflicts flare , you live by the ru - & mdash ; law of wars .& ldquo ; What sets us apart from the terrorists is we believe in the fundamental dignity of every human life & mdash ; Israeli , Palestinian , Arab , Jew , Muslim , Christian & mdash ; everyone .& rdquo ; The world is & ldquo ; looking to see what you are going to do ,& rdquo ; he said .
