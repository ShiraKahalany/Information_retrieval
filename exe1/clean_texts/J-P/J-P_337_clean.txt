An Israeli military court on Wednesday convicted a Palestinian rights activist of offenses in the West Bank , his lawyer said , in a case that Amnesty International described as politically motivated .
The military did not immediately provide Reuters with the Ofer military court @@@ s verdict against Issa Amro of the Palestinian city of Hebron , and arguments over sentencing will await a further hearing on Feb . 8 .
Amro denied the charges , which included protesting without a permit , obstructing Israeli soldiers @@@ activities in the flashpoint city of Hebron and assaulting a Jewish settler .
Amro , 40 , founded an activist group that regularly protests against settlement construction in Hebron . Under heavy Israeli military protection , around 1 , 000 settlers live there among 200 , 000 Palestinians .
& quot ; It doesn @@@ t make sense to punish someone for non - violent resistance ,& quot ; Amro told Reuters . & quot ; The Israeli military system exists only to oppress Palestinians and restrict freedom of speech .& quot ;
Amro was convicted on six of 18 charges against him , in incidents that occurred between 2010 and 2016 , his lawyer , Gaby Lasky , said .
Lasky said it was hard to predict whether Amro would face prison time , but that a Palestinian in a similar case received a 10 - month term .
Amnesty International said the charges against Amro were & quot ; politically motivated and linked to his peaceful work in exposing Israel @@@ s human rights violations .& quot ;
The group has also condemned as & quot ; disgraceful & quot ; charges brought against Amro by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank .
Amnesty said the PA has accused him of & quot ; disturbing public order & quot ; and & quot ; insulting higher authorities & quot ; over Facebook posts in 2017 critical of Palestinian leaders .
Amro said his next Palestinian court hearing is on Jan . 20 .
Most countries view settlements Israel built on West Bank land captured in a 1967 war as illegal . Israel disputes this , citing biblical and historical connections to the territory , as well as security needs .
