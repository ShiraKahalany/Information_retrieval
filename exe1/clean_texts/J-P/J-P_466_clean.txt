PM Lapid ' s first trip abroadיוצא לביקור מדיני ראשון כראש ממשלת ישראל בצרפת 🇫🇷🇮🇱 pic . twitter . com / 8pHOoutHJu & mdash ; יאיר לפיד - Yair Lapid (@ yairlapid ) July 5 , 2022The visit to Paris was Lapid & rsquo ; s first trip abroad as prime minister and a reunion of two politicians who have been friends for nearly a decade , since Lapid was finance minister and Macron was economy minister . They bonded over forming centrist political parties and have discussed ways to promote centrist politics . They are in regular contact over the WhatsApp messaging application . Macron grinned when Lapid arrived at the Elysee Palace in a Renault hatchback , and they embraced , walking into the presidential building with their arms around each other . The French president was effusive in his praise of the new Israeli prime minister .& ldquo ; You chose France as your first visit abroad , something I found very moving , dear Yair ,& rdquo ; Macron said . & ldquo ; The people of Israel are lucky to have you as their new prime minister .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s a true pleasure for my first visit as prime minister to be to a country and president that is a close friend ,& rdquo ; Lapid said . Following his meeting with Macron , Lapid was asked whether he would meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . Lapid said he would not & ldquo ; have a meeting for the sake of a meeting . I would only do it if there was a chance of a positive result for Israel , so it is not at the agenda for the moment .& rdquo ; Lapid said , however , he would not rule out such a meeting . The Palestinian issue came up in the meeting with Macron , but it was only a small part of the conversation , a source in Lapid & rsquo ; s entourage said . Macron understands that the makeup of the current Israeli government does not allow for major developments on that front , the source added . Iran nuclear dealMacron said the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , the 2015 Iran deal that Western powers have yet to give up on reviving , & ldquo ; will not be enough , but I do believe we need to keep Iran below the nuclear threshold .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; We need to continue talks with the Americans and negotiations on their regional and ballistic activities ,& rdquo ; he said . Lapid said Israel and France & ldquo ; may disagree about what the content of the agreement should be , but we do not disagree on the facts : Iran continues to violate the agreement and develop its program , enriching uranium beyond the level it is allowed to and removing cameras from nuclear sites .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; We need to continue talks with the Americans and negotiations on their regional and ballistic activities & rdquo ; Emmanuel & nbsp ; Macron & ldquo ; In 2018 ,& rdquo ; Macron was & ldquo ; the first leader to talk about the need for a new deal with Iran , with no expiration dates and coordinated international pressure to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear - threshold state ,& rdquo ; he said . Macron made the 2018 proposal after then - US president Donald Trump left the JCPOA , and he has supported US President Joe Biden & rsquo ; s efforts to return to it .& ldquo ; The Americans and Europeans think there will not be an agreement with Iran ,& rdquo ; Lapid said following the two - hour meeting . & ldquo ; If there isn & rsquo ; t an agreement , we need something else .& rdquo ; The JCPOA is so favorable to Iran , & ldquo ; if Iran doesn & rsquo ; t agree to this , then nothing will happen unless there is a credible military threat ,& rdquo ; he said . Israel also advocated for the parties to the JCPOA to institute snapback sanctions & ndash ; a reinstatement of sanctions lifted if Iran violates the agreement .& ldquo ; I tell this to the French , the Americans , everyone ,& rdquo ; Lapid said . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s time for snapback . We need to bring it to the UN Security Council .& rdquo ; Three days after the IAF shot down three drones that Hezbollah directed toward the Karish gas field in the Mediterranean Sea , Lapid said : & ldquo ; Israel will not sit back and do nothing given these repeated attacks .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; Hezbollah is a terrorist group that threatens Lebanon & rsquo ; s stability and sovereignty , threatens Israel & rsquo ; s security and harms the national interests of Lebanon ,& rdquo ; he said at the Elysee Palace . Lapid showed Macron intelligence on how Hezbollah is threatening Lebanese and French interests .& ldquo ; This is connected to the attack on the Karish gas rig , which we feel is an attack on Israeli sovereignty ,& rdquo ; Lapid said in a press briefing following the meeting . & ldquo ; We want to prevent this from continuing so we don & rsquo ; t have to use military force .& rdquo ; Macron said Lebanon & rsquo ; s stability is a key element of regional stability .& ldquo ; We will continue to help get Lebanon back on its feet ,& rdquo ; he said . Macron called for the continuation of negotiations between Israel and Lebanon on their maritime border . & ldquo ; The countries must reach an agreement to develop energy resources ,& rdquo ; he said . The energy company Total , which is partially owned by the French government , has the rights to gas exploration in Lebanon & rsquo ; s economic waters , an Israeli official said , adding that settling the maritime border dispute with Israel would also benefit France . Macron also spoke of France & rsquo ; s strong relationship with Israel .& ldquo ; You can count on France & rsquo ; s commitment to Israel & rsquo ; s security and to make sure the region enjoys stability and security ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; You can count on my commitment to fight our common enemy & ndash ; terrorism & hellip ; Never forget that here , in Paris , you have a friend committed to Israel & rsquo ; s success in the region .& rdquo ; Lapid and Macron said they wanted to enhance the strategic dialogue between their countries on military and technological cooperation .& ldquo ; There had been a feeling that the days of war in Europe are over , but Ukraine showed us that isn & rsquo ; t true ,& rdquo ; Lapid said . & ldquo ; France is going to strengthen its army , and we have a lot to contribute on this front .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
