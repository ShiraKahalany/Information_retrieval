The Eurovision 2024 slogan is & ldquo ; United by Music ,& rdquo ; but Israeli Eurovision fans fear that the true slogan this year may be & ldquo ; United by Hate and Antisemitism .& rdquo ; It was never going to be easy for Eden Golan , Israel & rsquo ; s contestant , to compete in Eurovision in 2024 during the war with Hamas , but the fact that the international song contest will be held this year in Malmo , Sweden , considered to be one of the most antisemitic cities in the world , has made it infinitely more complicated and dangerous for Israel to take part .& nbsp ; The war would have affected Israel & rsquo ; s participation in any city , but last year , when Sweden & rsquo ; s Loreen won the competition with her song , & ldquo ; Tattoo ,& rdquo ; it guaranteed that the competition would move to Malmo , since the contest is held in the home country of the previous year & rsquo ; s winner .& nbsp ; A city known for antisemitic threats and harassmentMalmo , Sweden & rsquo ; s third largest city , is a port city connected by the Oresund Bridge to Copenhagen , but its location , unfortunately does not ensure that it is cosmopolitan or tolerant . Malmo has a population of a little over 350 , 000 and there are about 100 , 000 Muslims in the region . In recent years , the small Jewish community in the city has reported serious antisemitic threats and harassment from Malmo & rsquo ; s Muslim residents . Israeli Eurovision contestants have always performed under heavy security , but according to multiple media reports , security measures have been heightened greatly in advance of this year & rsquo ; s contest , which will open on May 7 .& nbsp ; Golan is set to perform in the semi - final on May 9 . She and the entire Israeli delegation & ndash ; consisting of her dancers , musicians , stylists , and others & ndash ; is said to have been told by the Shin Bet , Israel & rsquo ; s security service , to stay in their Malmo hotel rooms at all times , except when Golan is actually performing .& nbsp ; While Israelis have always needed security , past Israeli delegations to Eurovision contests have had at least some opportunity to mingle with the other delegations and enjoy the cities in which the contest has been held , an important part of participating in an international competition . But this year , the focus will be on keeping them safe to the exclusion of everything else in the wake of anti - war protests and threats . A recent report by Keshet 12 News correspondents Ohad Hemo and Elad Simchayoff on Malmo revealed a disturbing level of antisemitism among the Muslim population of the city . The reporters and their crew were threatened , assaulted , and spit on many times by Muslim residents of Malmo who heard them speaking Hebrew . Being filmed did not deter these harassers .& nbsp ; One Jewish resident of an upscale Malmo neighborhood told the Keshet correspondents that she was alerted to the Hamas attack on the morning of October 7 by hearing cheers from the street that were so loud that they woke her . Yair Elsner , also a Jewish Malmo resident , told them that in the first weeks after October 7 , he would walk from his building to his car carrying a knife to protect himself .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; You go outside and you see exactly the same people who did October 7 , but here . There is no difference & ndash ; there is no reason to assume that they wouldn & rsquo ; t be able to commit the same atrocities on us here if only they could ,& rdquo ; he told them .& nbsp ; Keshet reported that seven out of 10 Swedish Jews testified in a recent survey that their lives had become more difficult following October 7 and about half of them said they had considered or were considering leaving the country . Perhaps the most chilling aspect of their report was that guards at a Malmo mosque , who did not realize that the Keshet correspondents were Jewish , told them that they had heard there would be a bomb attack at Eurovision and that everyone they knew was going to stay away from Malmo Arena , where the contest will take place .& nbsp ; UNFORTUNATELY , antisemitism in Malmo is nothing new . Fourteen years ago , the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel warning for Jews to southern Sweden and especially to Malmo . In 2015 , a Swedish journalist walked around the city wearing a kippah and a Star of David had to stop filming earlier than planned because so many people threatened him , cursed him , and threw eggs at him .& nbsp ; In 2016 , Danish Jewish actor Kim Bodnia quit the hit detective series , The Bridge , which was filmed in Malmo and Copenhagen , saying in an interview , & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not very comfortable to be [ in Malmo ] as a Jewish person .& rdquo ; It isn & rsquo ; t only antisemitism that is on the rise in Sweden , but lawlessness in general . According to reports , in 2022 , in Stockholm , the number of gun murders was 30 times higher than that of London . & ldquo ; These are difficult times for Sweden ,& rdquo ; Olaf Kristersson , the prime minister said . & ldquo ; Sweden has never seen anything like this before & ndash ; no other country in Europe has seen anything like this .& rdquo ; While Sweden may have the reputation of being a clean , prosperous country with great social services such as health care and a high standard of living , in recent years , it has been coping with an epidemic of drug gang violence that includes bomb and grenade attacks .& nbsp ; In an article headlined , & ldquo ; Sweden & rsquo ; s new normal : Bombs in the suburbs on a weeknight & rdquo ; in Politico , Charles Duxbury wrote in early October 2023 : & ldquo ; The upswell of [ gang ] violence has been so intense , widespread , and chaotically executed & ndash ; inexperienced teenage boys are often recruited to carry out the attacks & ndash ; that there is a growing sense here that no one is safe from it .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; According to The Guardian , in 2023 there were 149 successful bomb detonations and 62 attempted bombings in Sweden , in a country with a total population of about 10 . 5 million people .& nbsp ; THE LAWLESSNESS and antisemitism have combined to give Israeli security the challenge of a lifetime , while the delegation will also have to cope with hostility from other Eurovision contestants . Some artists have called for Israel to be banned from Eurovision , as Russia was following its invasion of Ukraine , but the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ), which runs Eurovision , has reiterated its stance that it is a contest for broadcasters , not governments , and that Israel & rsquo ; s Kan broadcaster has done nothing wrong .& nbsp ; Yet , despite the threat level , Eden Golan & rsquo ; s song , & ldquo ; Hurricane & rdquo ; has consistently been in the top 10 in the Eurovision betting tables , considered a reliable measure of success in the contest ; at presstime , & ldquo ; Hurricane & rdquo ; was in the seventh spot out of 37 countries .& nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s original choice for its song , & ldquo ; October Rain ,& rdquo ; was rejected by the EBU . Eurovision & rsquo ; s policy is that songs should avoid specific political content and the song was seen as a comment on the Hamas massacre , which it unquestionably was .& nbsp ; The new song , & ldquo ; Hurricane ,& rdquo ; made the lyrics vaguer , although the sentiment expressed is essentially the same . The music video released for the song shows Golan singing at a location that looks much like the Supernova music festival , where about 10 % of the attendees were murdered and taken hostage on October 7 , with dancers seemingly writhing in agony .& nbsp ; Israel began taking part in Eurovision in 1973 , even though it is not in Europe , since it would not have been welcomed in a Middle Eastern regional song contest . It took home the top prize in 1978 and 1979 with wins for Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta for the song & ldquo ; A - Ba - Ni - Bi ,& rdquo ; and Milk and Honey for & ldquo ; Hallelujah ,& rdquo ; respectively , and again in 1998 with International & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; Diva .& rdquo ; In 2018 , Netta Barzilai became Israel & rsquo ; s fourth Eurovision winner with her rousing rendition of & ldquo ; Toy ,& rdquo ; and in 2023 , pop star Noa Kirel came in third with her high - energy song , & ldquo ; Unicorn .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Golan , the 20 - year - old Israeli singer who spent much of her childhood in Russia , where she had a successful singing career , has shown great poise and determination in the face of the threats and hostility .& nbsp ; She told Eurovision Fun earlier this week that she had complete trust in her security detail and was excited to compete . & ldquo ; This is my dream coming true . Represent my country and do something big in front of the whole world !& rdquo ; she said .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; This year it takes on a different and greater meaning , to stand there on stage and show that we are here . We & rsquo ; ve been through & lsquo ; hurricanes & rsquo ; to get to this , I really want to do it and I believe we & rsquo ; ll go to the final , but our participation is an achievement on its own , and it & rsquo ; s an honor .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; This year & rsquo ; s show is completely different from any other year and the message is that you trust me . The viewers chose me and they believe in me , which is crazy . I believe that everything happens for the best , and I have strength . All the years of preparation and working on my skills have built me up and made me strong enough for this moment .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; In the past , the glitzy production numbers , slick pop tunes , outrageous costumes , and breathless presenters have made Eurovision fun for its millions of fans around the world but this year , the theme of tolerance among nations will be tested .& nbsp ; Perhaps in a contest where the performer ranked second in the odds is a Croatian band called Baby Lasagna , we should keep in mind that the it & rsquo ; s just entertainment and that the real victory for Israel this year will be the safety and well - being of Golan and the entire Israeli delegation .& nbsp ;
