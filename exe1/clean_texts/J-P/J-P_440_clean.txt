United Nations Security Council members on Monday called for a restoration of calm as Israeli - Palestinian violence escalated in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip .
& nbsp ;
The Security Council held a closed - door session on Monday to discuss rising tensions in east Jerusalem , particularly around the Temple Mount , also known as al - Haram al - Sharif .
& nbsp ;
The meeting was held in New York just before Palestinians in Gaza launched rockets at Israel .
& nbsp ;
China , which holds the UNSC presidency this month , was expected to issue a statement on its behalf later in the day .
& nbsp ;
After the meeting , Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jung tweeted : & ldquo ; Let & rsquo ; s work together for the de - escalation .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Vietnam & rsquo ; s mission to the UN tweeted a summary of what it told the Security Council , saying it expressed & ldquo ; grave concern ,& rdquo ; condemned & ldquo ; all acts of violence [ and urged ] all parties to exercise [ maximum ] restraint .& rdquo ; Hanoi also called on Israel to stop settlement activity and to halt & ldquo ; forced evictions & rdquo ; of Palestinians and & ldquo ; home demolitions .& rdquo ;

Diplomats said the briefing was requested by two - thirds of the 15 - member council & ndash ; Tunisia , Ireland , China , Estonia , France , Norway , Niger , St . Vincent and the Grenadines and Vietnam .

& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; All measures aimed at altering the demographic composition , character [ and ] status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 are illegal ,& rdquo ; it added .
& nbsp ;
The Trump administration had been supportive of Israel at the UN and used its veto power at the Security Council to protect the Jewish state from censure .
& nbsp ;
US President Joe Biden has promised to stand by Israel at the UN , but the Jerusalem and Gaza violence could test that resolve .
