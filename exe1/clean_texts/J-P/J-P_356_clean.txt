& nbsp ; Even with over 3 . 1 million Twitter followers and a popular weekly television show , British - American late - night television comedian & nbsp ; John Oliver does not run the world . Thank God .
& nbsp ;
Because if he did , or if he even ran a small country , Israel would be facing a humongous challenge on the international stage .
& nbsp ;
Oliver delivered a vicious 10 - minute attack on Israel on his Last Week Tonight show on Sunday that was as brutally unfair as it was void of any context . To sum up his simplistic argument : Israel is hitting Hamas much harder than Hamas is hitting Israel , more Palestinians are dying than Jews , so Israel is wrong , immoral and guilty of war crimes .
& nbsp ;
That & rsquo ; s the equivalent of saying that because an estimated 500 , 000 German civilians were killed in World War II , as opposed to & ldquo ; only & rdquo ; 67 , 000 British civilians , the Nazis were right in that war , and Britain was wrong .
& nbsp ;
And Oliver is not alone . Other late - night comedians , such as Trevor Noah , have jumped into the fray with their pearls of geopolitical wisdom , as have various entertainers and celebrities .
& nbsp ;
What all that does , in a world where social media amplifies these voices well beyond what they deserve , is to create a sense among many Israelis that nobody understands us , that everyone is against us . And while the Olivers and Noahs are opinion influencers who have an oversized impact on a younger demographic that often gets its views of the world from those types of TV shows , the world & rsquo ; s governments & ndash ; most importantly that of the US & ndash ; are not internalizing their drivel . At least not yet .
& nbsp ;
As the second full week of Operation Guardian of the Walls is nearing completion , it would be a mistake to look at Oliver & rsquo ; s and Noah & rsquo ; s rants , or the tweets of radical progressive US congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar , or listen to the anti - Israel and often antisemitic chants at protests around the globe , and see that as representative of where Israel stands today in the world .
& nbsp ;
Those rants are bad , those tweets are infuriating , those chants are pernicious , but when it comes to the world & rsquo ; s reaction to Israel & rsquo ; s campaign against Hamas & ndash ; meaning the reaction of governments to Israel & rsquo ; s actions & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s situation vis - a - vis the governments of the world is better this time than it was during any of the previous rounds of violence with Hamas in Gaza .
& nbsp ;
US President Joe Biden and many other leaders around the world have given Israel the & ldquo ; critical time we needed & rdquo ; to carry out this operation , former National Security Council head Yaakov Amidror said .
& nbsp ;
Biden , who has come under pressure from within his own party , primarily from the progressive wing , to take a more active role and demand an immediate ceasefire , said on Wednesday during a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he supported a ceasefire . Twenty - four hours later , in another call with Netanyahu , he said he & ldquo ; expected to see a significant de - escalation today on the path to a ceasefire .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
This was after nine days of giving unstinting support to Israel for its right to defend itself , and blocking three different UN Security Council statements calling for an immediate halt to the fighting without mentioning Hamas or the rockets from Gaza .
& nbsp ;
Some have characterized Biden & rsquo ; s call that he expects a de - escalation as US pressure , others that it portends an imminent crisis in ties between the two leaders and the two countries . Amidror cautions against hyperbole .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think there is pressure ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; I think that what the Americans are saying is that they want to see a ceasefire . But that is not pressure . They understand the need for Israel to complete the operation , they understand we are talking about a terrorist organization that crossed all redlines , opened fire on Israeli cities . Therefore the administration gave us time .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I MAKE no pretense of understanding how America works ,& rdquo ; said Amidror , a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security . & ldquo ; I look at what they have done , and what they have done up until now is to give us the time we needed .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Amidror said he was not surprised by this , since the leadership in the Democratic Party & ndash ; & ldquo ; contrary to the perception here & rdquo ; & ndash ; still maintains & ldquo ; checks and balances over the radical progressive element within the party that sometimes contains antisemitic elements .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
What is ironic about Biden & rsquo ; s support is that it has disappointed some on the Right , because it disrupts their narrative that Biden is a reincarnation of Barack Obama who will squeeze Israel at the first opportunity , and at the same time has also disappointed some on the Left who would like to see much less support for Israel .
& nbsp ;
There are also Israeli domestic agendas at work among those who want to characterize Biden & rsquo ; s comments as & ldquo ; pressure .& rdquo ; Those politically opposed to Netanyahu would like to cast him now in the role as someone on a collision course with Biden and his administration , while the prime minister & rsquo ; s supporters are keen on painting a picture of perfect harmony between the two men who have known each other for nearly 40 years .
& nbsp ;
But there are objective standards against which to judge pressure to withdraw . Here & rsquo ; s one : In April 2002 , just nine days into Israel & rsquo ; s Operation Protective Shield aimed at crushing the terrorist infrastructure in the West Bank that was responsible for hundreds of deaths during the Second Intifada , president George W . Bush called on prime minister Ariel Sharon to withdraw IDF troops immediately from the Palestinian cities they had moved into .
& nbsp ;
At a press conference in Crawford , Texas , Bush said , & ldquo ; My words to Israel are the same today as they were a couple of days ago : Withdraw without delay .& rdquo ; He added that he expected Israel to & ldquo ; heed my advice .& rdquo ; Sharon didn & rsquo ; t , the military campaign went on for another month , and US - Israel ties survived .
& nbsp ;
Biden & rsquo ; s expectation of de - escalation and support for a ceasefire does not come near that Bush standard of rhetorical pressure .
& nbsp ;
AVIV SHIRON , a recently retired diplomat who previously served stints as Israel & rsquo ; s ambassador to the Netherlands , Austria and Switzerland , said that in comparison with other rounds of violence in Gaza in the past , & ldquo ; the international pressure this time is less significant and massive .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We have seen the new US president give full support to Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and did not demand an immediate ceasefire . Now he is calling for a ceasefire , but we are 11 days into the operation & ndash ; that is very significant .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Also inside the European Union , which is always more critical , there were more countries this time that supported Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and did not demand a ceasefire .& rdquo ; He also pointed out that Israeli flags were flown atop government buildings in Germany , Austria , the Czech Republic and Slovenia as a sign of solidarity .
& nbsp ;
Shiron attributed this primarily to the fewer civilian casualties in Gaza than in the past . & ldquo ; The collateral damage is less , and we are seeing fewer pictures of dead and injured and children , even though there are always civilian casualties .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The number of casualties in Gaza is less because the IDF and the air force have learned lessons from the past , and as a result pressure coming from various governments is less ,& rdquo ; he said .
& nbsp ;
Shiron maintained that anti - Israel protests on the streets of London , Paris , Berlin and Washington always accompany this type of conflict , and that there is little difference in them this time around . As they continue , there will be more pressure on various governments to speak out and take a stand , but & ldquo ; all in all things are better than in previous times .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas took advantage of existing tensions in Jerusalem as its pretense for launching attacks , and started the current campaign by firing at Jerusalem & ndash ; an act that succeeded in both playing on and building up passions of Muslims around the world , including among Israeli - Arabs , something Hamas certainly deems a & ldquo ; success .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
At the same time , however , Shiron said that firing on Jerusalem hurt Hamas in capitals around the world . & ldquo ; When you fire on Jerusalem , as opposed to Sderot , it is perceived differently in the world .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Amidror , who agreed with Shiron that Europe has largely given more support for Israel than in the past and allowed it to carry out its operations according to its own timeline , said there were three main reasons for this degree of understanding among many world governments .
& nbsp ;
First , he said , was Israeli restraint over incidents from Gaza in the weeks before Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem on May 10 . Second , is that it is clear to the governments around the world who started the conflagration .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; And the third thing is that they are shooting at civilian targets , while everyone understands we are shooting at military ones ,& rdquo ; Amidror said . & ldquo ; Sometimes we err and civilians are killed , but our intent & ndash ; and the direction of our fire & ndash ; is toward military targets , while they are shooting at civilians from among civilians .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Amidror said that even those critical of recent Israeli actions in Jerusalem , such as efforts to evict four families from Sheikh Jarrah and police activities during Ramadan at the Damascus Gate , understand that there are huge gaps between the claims of Israeli errors in this matter and the response .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; There is disproportionality between the claims against us , and the reactions . For the sake of argument , let & rsquo ; s say that they were right , that our behavior could have been gentler in Jerusalem . Does that justify rockets on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ? There is tremendous disproportionality .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
But that disproportionality & ldquo ; plays into our hands ,& rdquo ; Amidror said , as & ldquo ; reasonable people understand that a terrorist organization took advantage of the situation to fire on civilians .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
While Amidror maintained that the reaction of much of the world overall has not been overly bad , including Russia , China is an exception . There the overseas channel of state broadcaster CCTV aired a report shot - full with antisemitic tropes .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ;.... Some people believe that US pro - Israeli policy is traceable to the influence of wealthy Jews in the US and the Jewish lobby on US foreign policy - makers ,& rdquo ; said host Zheng Junfeng , asking his audience whether US support for Israel was truly based on shared values . & ldquo ; Jews dominate finance and Internet sectors . So do they have the powerful lobbies some say ? Possible .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Amidror took umbrage . & ldquo ; There is a big difference between being for a ceasefire and antisemitic claims ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; As someone who very much values the relationship with China , it pains me to see antisemitic claims in China compete with the antisemitic arguments of [ Turkish President Recep Tayyip ] Erdogan . This is beneath China .& rdquo ;
