Avigdor Liberman , head of Yisrael Beytenu party , criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday and claimed that he wants to recognize a Palestinian state ." As I said at the Knesset exactly a month ago , Netanyahu is about to dismantle the government based on an agreement with the Saudis ," he posted on social media platform X , formerly Twitter . כפי שהודעתי מעל בימת הכנסת לפני כחודש בדיוק , נתניהו עומד לפרק את הממשלה על בסיס הסכם עם הסעודים . להלן , תכנית נתניהו : 1 . הכרה ישראלית במדינה פלסטינית . יהיו לכך סיפורים נלווים מבית היוצר של נתניהו כמו מדינה פלסטינית מינוס , כלומר מדינה שאין לה צבא וישראל תשלוט במרחב האווירי שלה & hellip ;& mdash ; אביגדור ליברמן (@ AvigdorLiberman ) April 19 , 2024In his tweet , Liberman raised three points , which he claimed to be " Netanyahu ' s plan ." According to Liberman , Netanyahu supports the recognition of a Palestinian state , granting approval for the Saudi nuclear program and assisting to transfer it to US Congress , and finally a commitment not to attack nuclear facilities on Saudi soil . Netanyahu ' s motivation is to dissolve current coalitionLiberman argued that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s impetus for the plan is his desire to dissolve his current coalition , writing & ldquo ; he understands that recognizing a Palestinian state would break his coalition , the Knesset would dissolve and we would go for elections .& rdquo ; Further in his tweet , regarding the agreement with Saudi Arabia , Liberman added that it is a move aimed at helping Netanyahu escape taking responsibility for the October 7 massacre , saying that he & ldquo ; wants the main topic of the coming elections to be the agreement with Saudi , and not his responsibility in the worst disaster in the history of the State of Israel .& rdquo ; Liberman concluded his tweet saying , & ldquo ; We must refuse the establishment of a Palestinian state and the Saudi nuclear plan .& rdquo ; Liberman then suggested that a Saudi nuclear plan would lead & ldquo ; the entire region into a crazy nuclear race & rdquo ; that would include countries such as Egypt and Turkey .
