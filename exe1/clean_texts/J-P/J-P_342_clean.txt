The Tiv Ta & rsquo ; am supermarket chain will continue its price reduction strategy that began about three years ago , lowering the prices in the fruit and vegetable department in preparation for the Passover holiday . This is a 30 % discount rate for the vegetable and fruit products , and thus it will be comparable to the prices of the best - selling vegetables and fruits that make up the basic basket to the prices of Shufersal Deal ( Sunday - Wednesday ) and Shufersal Basket Online ( Thursday - Saturday ). Tiv Ta & rsquo ; am has chosen to discount about 20 products that are the best sellers in the department . The price update will begin this week in the major branches and on the website www . tivtaam . co . il .& nbsp ; The move will be accompanied by a festive campaign that will cost about half a million shekels under the slogan : " Cutting the prices of the fruits and vegetables , the same quality at a new price ."& nbsp ; Haggai Shalom , CEO and owner of the Tiv Ta & rsquo ; am Group : " This is a continuation of the price control process that we started in the network about four years ago , in which we reduced the prices of about 3 , 000 individual products from a variety of different departments to Shufersal Deal prices ." The move that is now being made in preparation for Passover and at a time when the cost of living is worrying everyone comes to strengthen the viability of everyday shopping and of course holiday shopping . The price reduction is carried out while taking care and maintaining the advantages that characterize the chain : quality , shopping experience , wide international culinary variety , service , and more ." Shalom also added that : " The price update is valid in the large chain stores . In the urban stores , we will continue to be competitive , high quality , diverse , and better than the competitors ."
