It seemed like we were watching the news on repeat : Jewish nationalists & nbsp ; marching through Jerusalem & nbsp ; waving Israeli flags as Hamas in the Gaza Strip warned it would fire rockets . Everyone was on the edge of their seats . Less than a month since a ceasefire was signed , was Israel set to go back to war ?
& nbsp ;
Throughout the day & nbsp ; incendiary and explosive balloons & nbsp ; landed in southern Israel , igniting more than 20 fires , but no rockets were fired .
& nbsp ;
Israel had deployed Iron Dome batteries close to the capital , reinforced batteries in the South and had thousands of Border Police officers secure the march . There were several injuries and arrests during the controversial march , but overall the day ended with quiet in the capital .
& nbsp ;
The Iron Dome batteries that had been deployed close to the capital stayed silent . Instead of rocket - warning sirens , the sirens of fire trucks rushing to the scene were heard .
& nbsp ;
The way that the two sides handled the day shows just how much restraint they employed , because neither Hamas nor Israel wants to go back to war so soon after the last round in May .
& nbsp ;
Hamas , which pushed itself into a corner with its threats and promises to the Palestinian people that it is the protector of al - Quds and al - Aqsa Mosque , resorted to its pressure tactics of balloons and night demonstrations along the border , instead of rocket fire .
& nbsp ;
But the balloons and demonstrations were not launched solely because of the flag march ; the group is also trying to pressure Israel into letting the millions of dollars of Qatari cash into Gaza , as well as restart the fuel transfers into the blockaded coastal enclave .
& nbsp ;
Hamas knows it cannot afford another war right now , especially with Egyptians in the Strip handling all aid sent . Egypt is an instrumental player when Israel and Gaza go to war , and Hamas knows that angering its neighbor to the south would not be the smartest move on its part .
& nbsp ;
A key strategic ally for Israel , Cairo had reconnaissance planes in the air over northern Sinai and off the Gazan coast throughout the day , likely to watch for any moves inside Gaza that would point to preparations of rocket fire .
& nbsp ;
If it wants to , Hamas can keep the quiet ; we have seen that over and over again . And not only did it prevent any fire from its operatives on Tuesday , but it made sure that Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups toed the line as well .
& nbsp ;
But the terrorist group still claimed victory , saying that it imposed a new set of rules on Israel following the 11 days of conflict .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The courageous stances of the Palestinian resistance , and its decisive decisions that forced the Israeli occupation to change the path of the so - called March of Flags away from the blessed al - Aqsa Mosque , change the path of civil aviation , and intensify the deployment of the Iron Dome , confirm the achievement of the deterrence equation it imposed in the Battle of Saif al - Quds , and its success in imposing new rules of engagement on the enemy ,& rdquo ; the group said Tuesday night .
& nbsp ;
THE DAY was a test for Israel under the new government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett , as well .
& nbsp ;
Bennett is a known hawk on defense issues . Shortly after he began his term as defense minister in November 2018 , he warned Hamas that & ldquo ; no one will be immune & rdquo ; from Israeli military action . The response to the launching of explosive balloons from the Strip would be similar to the launching of rockets , he said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The lawless conduct of Hamas leadership is bringing us closer to fatal action against them . We will not announce when or where , but no one will be immune ,& rdquo ; Bennett said at the time .
& nbsp ;
And he has kept repeating that .
& nbsp ;
So overnight , IDF jets carried out strikes against empty Hamas and PIJ compounds . They were the first airstrikes since the ceasefire and a warning to Hamas : we will not sit back quietly .
But does hitting empty compounds at night do anything to deter the group ? Israeli officials have said over and over again that & ldquo ; what was , will not be ,& rdquo ; so in order to stay true to their words , the Israel Air Force could have hit a target with more significance .
& nbsp ;
Opposition MK Israel Katz ( Likud ) tweeted Wednesday morning that & ldquo ; for every attack in Israel , targeted assassinations and widespread attacks on Hamas targets should be carried out . Not empty compounds .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Perhaps the Israelis were also walking a tightrope , knowing that widespread attacks in the Strip would not be welcomed by Cairo and could instead lead to a diplomatic crisis that Bennett could not afford so soon into his term .
& nbsp ;
Both Israel and Gaza have firepower to cause extensive damage , but no matter the threats by leaders in Jerusalem or Gaza , both sides are restrained both by Cairo and by their own internal issues .
