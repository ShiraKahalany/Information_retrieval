The Knesset on Tuesday held a special conference to mark International Women & rsquo ; s Day , under the title & ldquo ; Women & rsquo ; s Contributions in the Swords of Iron War .& rdquo ; Knesset Speaker MK Amir Ohana ( Likud ) said at the conference , held under the auspices of the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality , that he expects the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) to convene and determine & ldquo ; immediately and unequivocally & rdquo ; that Hamas is a terrorist organization , based on a UN report published on Monday that found & ldquo ; convincing information & rdquo ; that Hamas had committed sexual violence against Israeli women during the October 7 massacre and its aftermath . Committee chairwoman MK Pnina Tamano - Shata ( National Unity ) said that , after October 7 , International Women & rsquo ; s Day would never be the same .& ldquo ; It shocked our world forever , rocked the foundations of our secure existence in our country ,& rdquo ; she said , adding that & ldquo ; the pictures of mothers shielding infants and children with guns pointed at them , is a memory that will never fade .& rdquo ; Released Gaza hostage speaks outMia Regev , who was taken captive by Hamas on October 7 and released later in a hostage trade , played a recording of a telephone conversation with her father as she was being taken captive . Regev said that she & ldquo ; knew what it was like to be a woman there ,& rdquo ; where & ldquo ; at any moment they can come and murder your soul , [ which is ] more terrifying than death itself ,& rdquo ; and called for their release before it was & ldquo ; too late .& rdquo ; Earlier on Tuesday , a separate debate was held in the Knesset National Security Committee over the National Security Ministry & rsquo ; s decision to sever ties with the Michal Sela Forum , a forum that fights against domestic violence . Knesset members from the opposition claimed that the decision to sever ties was a political decision after the Forum argued that National Security Minister Itamar Ben - Gvir & rsquo ; s policy of increasing gun distribution could lead to increased domestic violence . Committee member MK Merav Ben - Ari ( Yesh Atid ) accused Harmelech of falsely accusing the Forum of & ldquo ; caring only for a small number of women & rdquo ; and of overspending on public relations and & ldquo ; populist acts .& rdquo ; Ben - Ari also accused Ben - Gvir aide David Bavli of speaking in a & ldquo ; derogatory and disgraceful manner ,& rdquo ; and criticized Fogel for cutting the discussion short & ldquo ; without giving a proper response to the distress and danger .& rdquo ; Fogel later wrote on social media , & ldquo ; I will not give a hand to disgracing the Knesset and turning an important discussion on preventing domestic violence in general and against women in particular into a Turkish film .& rdquo ;
