A convention hosted by Vox , Spain & rsquo ; s far - right party that has been criticized for welcoming neo - Nazis , counts Israel & rsquo ; s Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli among its featured speakers this weekend . Chikli is appearing at Europa Viva 24 , a conference joining Europe & rsquo ; s right - wing leaders and more than 10 , 000 attendees on Saturday and Sunday in Madrid . For Chikli , a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s right - wing Likud party , it & rsquo ; s the latest stop in a tour of engagements with European politicians who advocate pro - Israel positions from parties with antisemitic and neo - Nazi roots . Both Chikli and Javier Milei , Argentina & rsquo ; s new right - wing , pro - Israeli president , were invited to address the conference . In his speech , Chikli lambasted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez , who has sharply criticized Israel & rsquo ; s war against Hamas , which Chikli called & ldquo ; an existential battle for the future of humanity .& rdquo ; In Spain , Vox is controversial both for its platform & mdash ; which includes restricting abortion access , repealing domestic violence laws , and shuttering the ministry of equality & mdash ; and for a history of neo - Nazis in its ranks . Five years ago , the party nominated Holocaust revisionist Fernando Paz as a congressional candidate . Paz has said the facts of the Holocaust are & ldquo ; far from being established with accuracy & rdquo ; and called the Nuremberg trials a & ldquo ; farce .& rdquo ; Vox is also home to Jordi de la Fuente , a member of the Barcelona government who previously led the neo - fascist Republican Social Movement , which dissolved in 2018 . Other Vox members have included Jos & eacute ; Mar & iacute ; a Ruiz Puerta , who led the neo - Nazi group CEDADE , and Jos & eacute ; Ignacio Vega Peinado , who was part of the neo - Nazi group Radical Action in the 1990s and received prison time for attacking and permanently disabling a professor at the University of Valencia . Pedro Valera , a leader of Spanish neo - Nazism who has served jail time for disseminating hate speech , also recently appeared at Vox & rsquo ; s closing campaign ceremony in Barcelona . Until recently , officials in the Likud party were discouraged from promoting alliances with Vox . In 2019 , Netanyahu & rsquo ; s then - foreign affairs director Eli Hazan tweeted his support for the party and faced enough backlash to delete and apologize for the post . Growing ties between Israel ' s Likud and Spain ' s Vox parties & nbsp ; But those boundaries have disappeared under Israel & rsquo ; s current right - wing government . In December , Chikli met with Vox president Santiago Abascal , whom he called & ldquo ; a man of truth who , in the twilight of Western civilization , where moral relativism threatens to collapse it , stands as a beacon of moral clarity .& rdquo ; Last month , Chikli attended CPAC Hungary and praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a & ldquo ; supporter of Israel .& rdquo ; ( The authoritarian leader has been condemned by US antisemitism envoy Deborah Lipstadt for & ldquo ; rhetoric that clearly evokes Nazi racial ideology ,& rdquo ; as well as by Hungarian rabbis .) Chikli spoke alongside Tom Van Grieken , president of Belgium & rsquo ; s Vlaams Belang party , which promotes the & ldquo ; Great Replacement & rdquo ; conspiracy theory and uses the Nazi term & ldquo ; omvolking & rdquo ; (& ldquo ; repopulation & rdquo ;), mainly referring to European immigration from Muslim countries . Chikli also met earlier this year with Sweden & rsquo ; s far - right party , the Swedish Democrats . The second - largest party in the Swedish parliament , it has a history of Nazi founders and its members have been criticized for connections with neo - Nazi movements even in recent years . Israel has so far avoided establishing official ties with the party , but the Swedish Democrats & nbsp ; have declared it & ldquo ; the most pro - Israel party in Sweden .& rdquo ; Chikli & rsquo ; s ministry is charged with engaging and supporting the half of Jews who do not live in Israel ; he added fighting antisemitism to its mandate when he assumed the position last year . But while Chikli is strengthening his bond with far - right European parties , he has said that he is not interested in building a relationship with some Jews around the world . In January , at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association in Krakow , Chikli said his official capacity would not induce him to build alliances with Diaspora Jews who participate in international protests against Israel & rsquo ; s military assault in Gaza .& ldquo ; A Jew who feels at home surrounded by a mob that is shouting , & lsquo ; From the river to the sea , Palestine will be free ,& rsquo ; I don & rsquo ; t consider him a Jew ,& rdquo ; Chikli told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency . & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t want to build a bridge with him .& rdquo ;
