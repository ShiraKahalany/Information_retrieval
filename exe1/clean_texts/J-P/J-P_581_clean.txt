Former New York City mayor and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg convened a roundtable discussion of Israeli mayors in Tel Aviv on Thursday to launch a recovery and repair innovation initiative for the hardest - hit cities in Israel amid the war ; it & nbsp ; was unveiled exclusively to The Jerusalem Post . The initiative , under Bloomberg Philanthropies , intends to provide both support and expertise based on vast experience in other conflict zones to the most affected communities across Israel that suffered following the massacre on October 7 and during the subsequent war . Committed to providing support for Israel during the war & nbsp ;& ldquo ; I know this continues to be an extremely difficult time for everyone & ndash ; and for Israel & ndash ; and that & rsquo ; s why I & rsquo ; m here ,& rdquo ; Bloomberg said in his opening remarks . & ldquo ; I have great confidence in Israel & rsquo ; s future & ndash ; because I believe in the power of those values .& ldquo ; Those values have been attacked before & ndash ; and they will be attacked again . But time and again , we have seen the power of people who believe in those values to overcome the worst in human nature . That is America & rsquo ; s story & ndash ; it is Israel & rsquo ; s story & ndash ; it & rsquo ; s the story of the free world and it endures because it connects to something deep within the human spirit that no government , and no terrorist group , can kill .& rdquo ; Seated at the roundtable were mayors from all sectors , Jewish and Arab alike , including Tzvika Brot of Bat Yam ; Rafik Halabi of Daliat al - Carmel ; Miriam Fierberg of Netanya ; Mazen Ghnaim of Sakhnin ; Rotem Yadlin of Gezer Regional Council ; and Raed Daka of Baka al - Gharbiya . The group gathered at the Bloomberg Sagol Center for City Leadership at Tel Aviv University to discuss a & ldquo ; new program that will help bring world - class expertise to support 65 localities ,& rdquo ; according to Bloomberg . Tel Aviv University President Prof . Ariel Porat said , & ldquo ; The Israeli government failed to provide its citizens with all kinds of different services . The municipalities could and should play an important role .& rdquo ; Indeed , the program intends to see the development of regional innovation hubs designed to serve each cluster & rsquo ; s communities and their respective municipalities and help them rebuild stronger , with particular focus on the hardest - hit regions rather than individual cities because & ldquo ; regional dependency and interdependence amongst communities is such a big priority ,& rdquo ; according to James Anderson , who established and leads the Government Innovation program at Bloomberg Philanthropies and is the architect of the organization & rsquo ; s work supporting mayoral leadership and driving local innovation in Israel . Speaking to the Post , he said communities & ldquo ; really want our support ... to enable and encourage that sort of regional thinking as communities build back better .& rdquo ; The focus of Bloomberg PhilanthropiesBloomberg Philanthropies will focus specifically on bringing resources and capabilities in data science , the digitization of public services , program design , and collaboration management to develop and implement projects emphasizing recovery , resilience , and regional connectivity . The mayors and municipal heads in attendance , in a closed - door discussion , raised questions and concerns that may be met through the initiative , and in turn , Bloomberg & rsquo ; s team of professionals is taking feedback , applying necessary customizations , and initiating customized programs specifically to help each affected area . Anderson said , & ldquo ; The government innovation program at Bloomberg Philanthropies really comes from Mike and the fact that he is the only major funder on the globe , who also happened to have been a mayor & rdquo ; and therefore & ldquo ; understands the unique role mayors can play in moving us forward at the community level , at the national level , at the global level .& ldquo ; We started our work in Israel 10 years ago , we brought our Bloomberg innovation model to Tel Aviv , Jerusalem Beersheba , and ... all three of those cities do extraordinary things with that investment ,& rdquo ; Anderson explained , adding that they are developing new programs according to the needs of cities around the world , and this is informing their choices in Israel , whether they learned it in Kyiv due to the Russia - Ukraine war or in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Sandy last decade . Bloomberg revealed that & ldquo ; outside of the United States , we do more work with mayors in Israel than in any other country in the world & ndash ; and that & rsquo ; s something that I know would & rsquo ; ve made my mother and father very proud . It & rsquo ; s times like this & ndash ; times of crisis and conflict , when people are deeply worried about the future & ndash ; that mayors are more important than ever .& rdquo ; Indeed , Bloomberg & rsquo ; s personal experience in the centrality of mayoral leadership in times of crisis informed plenty of his work with mayoral programs through Bloomberg Philanthropies . Bloomberg was mayor of New York City from the beginning of 2002 , shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , during which four coordinated Islamist suicide terrorist attacks were carried out by al - Qaeda against the US , including two planes crashing into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center .& ldquo ; I learned very quickly that mayors have a unique opportunity to be beacons of hope & ndash ; and to rally people behind a shared vision that unites people of all backgrounds and all religions ,& rdquo ; Bloomberg said . & ldquo ; They also have a powerful role to play in helping communities recover and rebuild and to show residents that even in a crisis , government can work for them and get things done , whether that & rsquo ; s building infrastructure or getting families back in their homes and schools .& rdquo ;
