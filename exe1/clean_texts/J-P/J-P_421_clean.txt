& nbsp ; Fakhri Abu Diab lives in east Jerusalem , but everything he knows about Israel & rsquo ; s capital is different from the one that his Jewish neighbors love .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Anyone who comes to east Jerusalem knows that it is not the same city and not the same language ,& rdquo ; said Abu Diab , who is a spokesman for the Silwan neighborhood .
& nbsp ;
The barrier that once divided Jerusalem prior to 1967 has long since been torn down . Fifty - four years have passed since Israel created a united capital when it wrested control of the eastern part of the city from Jordan during the Six Day War .
& nbsp ;
Next week , as Israel celebrates Jerusalem Day to mark that victory , few will remember where that barrier really stood , but the scars of the division still resonate in the city .
& nbsp ;
At issue are not just the cultural and linguistic differences between the Palestinian population that largely lives in east Jerusalem and makes up 39 % of the municipality & rsquo ; s 900 , 000 people .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Geopolitics plays a role . Most of the international community supports a divided Jerusalem , where the eastern part of the city would be the capital of a future Palestinian state . An additional complicating factor is the fact that most of the Palestinians have Jerusalem residency but lack Israeli citizenship .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
But over time , for many Jewish Israelis , the differences have almost begun to appear cosmetic . They walked around a city that easily looks united and whose redivision seems unrealistic and unfeasible .
& nbsp ;
For Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan - Nahoum the city & rsquo ; s unity is obvious .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Jerusalem is a city comprised of communities . That is the essence of Jerusalem . It is a city of communities , but it is a united city . What makes it united ? You have one municipal authority taking care of all of its residents ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
That authority is in charge of transport , health , education and public spaces , she added .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; That municipal authority , especially in the last few years , has made it a point of being an inclusive authority , where everyone has a voice , and where everyone can approach the mayor and the deputy mayor and can advocate for their community and receive resources for that community ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; On a public level , what we have seen in the last five to 10 years is a city that is more integrated than it has ever been . Ten years ago , you never had a young Arab student working in Fox ,& rdquo ; Hassan - Nahoum said , adding that many of the shops throughout the city are staffed by Arab residents .
& nbsp ;
Today , public space is shared by Jewish and Arab residents of the city , including in coffee shops and gyms .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Whether people admit it or not , whether the detractors can still point fingers at the divided city & ndash ; in essence , in the day - to - day experience for most people ,& rdquo ; the city is integrated physically , logistically and relationally , she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think our work is finished ,& rdquo ; she said , adding that more needs to be done on issues of equity and job placement , particularly in the hi - tech industry , but that is true with respect to any community that has been marginalized , she said .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
For many years the governments of Israel , whether left or right , did not know what to do with the issue of east Jerusalem , Hassan - Nahoum said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Left thinks one day it will be the capital of a Palestinian state , and the right wing is concerned with other issues ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
Partially , she said , the problem lay with the Palestinians themselves .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We had a hostile community , with little leadership , manipulated by the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah . It was difficult . I am not saying it was all their fault , but I believe we are in a different place now . The Arabs in east Jerusalem are realizing that they are getting zero , nothing , from the Palestinian leadership , she said .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
She credited Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion and former Jerusalem Affairs minister Ze & rsquo ; ev Elkin , now a New Hope MK , for making strides in closing the equity gaps between Jewish and Arab residents of the city , including the development of partnership with the local Arab leadership .
& nbsp ;
When riots broke out a few weeks ago , Lion , who is Sabbath observant , walked on Saturday to meet with community leaders to seek a way to calm the situation , she said .
& nbsp ;
The city & rsquo ; s unity was most clearly apparent , she said , during the COVID - 19 pandemic , when everyone banded together to fight a common enemy .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It was beautiful . It was a difficult time , but we came together as a city and that is the measure of how far we have come ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The DNA of Jerusalem is one of diversity ,& rdquo ; she said , as she explained that King David chose this space to build this city 3 , 000 years ago because it did not belong to any one tribe and thus it could be a place where everyone could gather together .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Our DNA is one of convergence , of east and west , of old and new , of past and future and heaven and earth . We will solve all of the conflicts in our country and in our region from Jerusalem ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
THE EXECUTIVE director of the left - wing NGO Ir Amim , Yudith Oppenheimer , said that , factually speaking , Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 and since then it has been managed by one municipality .
& nbsp ;
On the surface , & ldquo ; you can look at Jerusalem and say here is an urban space in which people can move from one place to another , so maybe this is a united city ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer said .
& nbsp ;
But & ldquo ; when you look deeper into the situation , you see that the city is actually divided in many aspects , and each one portrays a picture of two very unequal societies , in which one controls the other ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer added .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; One side has all the resources and is very dedicated to expressing its hegemony ,& rdquo ; and the other side lacks those resources , she said .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
The issue , she said , starts with the fact that most of the city & rsquo ; s Palestinian residents lack Israeli citizenship and have only residency rights . Those rights are conditional and can easily be removed , she explained , adding that this insecure status dominates many aspects of their lives , she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Everything is conditional . They may not leave the city ; they may lose their residency status . They cannot build in the city , but they have to live in the city , or they lose all their entitlement to the city ,& rdquo ; Oppenheimer said .
& nbsp ;
Palestinians have individual rights in Jerusalem but not collective ones , she said .
& nbsp ;
Oppenheimer dismissed claims that the Palestinians are to blame for this situation because they refused to take citizenship . & ldquo ; This is an urban legend ,& rdquo ; she said . Palestinians were never offered collective citizenship , but rather the right to apply individually and that application is very complicated .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It takes years and many are denied ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
Those who do not want citizenship should be offered permanent residency that cannot be easily revoked , so that they can live their lives more securely , she said .
& nbsp ;
The issue of inequity is the main issue , she said , and that issue is separate from the final political status of Jerusalem , which needs to be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians , she explained .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; So is the city united ?& rdquo ; she asked . It & rsquo ; s those who speak so highly of unity that seem to want it the least , she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Do they really want for Jerusalem to be united in a meaningful way , in the full meaning of what it means ? Because their actions actually say the opposite ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
Her organization , she said , supports a two - state resolution to the conflict in which Jerusalem would be the capital of both an Israeli and a Palestinian state .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; But this doesn & rsquo ; t mean that the city has to be physically divided ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; It is getting more and more difficult to divide the city . If you ask , the majority of the residents actually enjoy the diversity that the city offers and do not want to see the city divided again .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
There are creative ways to create two capitals without physically dividing the city , and the sustainability of a two - state solution depends on the capacity of Israelis and Palestinians to share the municipal public space in the fullest way possible , Oppenheimer said .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
The issue is not about dividing the city but about sharing it , she said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We are actually working very hard not for a vision of divided or united , but for a vision of shared city ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
Abu Diab said it is clear to him that the city is divided .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The food is different , even the dreams are different ,& rdquo ; he said .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Here they [ Palestinians ] know they are living under occupation ,& rdquo ; said Abu Diab who does not consider himself unified with the Jewish residents of the city . & ldquo ; We think they are not living with us and that they want to live without us ,& rdquo ; he added .
& nbsp ;
He has never sought Israeli citizenship , nor does he want it . He dreams of being a citizen of a future Palestinian state in which east Jerusalem will be its capital . But this doesn & rsquo ; t mean he imagines that a wall would divide the city , but , rather , that the city would be governed by two different entities , with its citizens walking freely between both .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Jerusalem belongs to everyone . It should be a city of love and peace and nonviolence . It should be an international city , but allow for everyone to be part of their own people ,& rdquo ; he explained .
& nbsp ;
SARA HAETZNI - COHEN , who chairs the right - wing NGO My Israel Movement , said that obviously Jerusalem is Israel & rsquo ; s united capital and , as such , all effort must be made to ensure that this is true in practice and not just a slogan .
& nbsp ;
To make that happen , she said , the issue of inequity between the eastern and western parts of the city must be addressed and it must be the Right that leads that charge .
& nbsp ;
Failure to do that , she said , gives an erroneous message that Israeli sovereignty in east Jerusalem is temporary . There is little reason to invest in neighborhoods that will one day be given away .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Israel has to make a statement of sovereignty by normalizing its treatment of those neighborhoods , including offering Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians who seek it , she said .
& nbsp ;
Otherwise , Palestinians have the feeling they are temporary here , Haetzni - Cohen said .
& nbsp ;
From the start , Israel made a decision to apply sovereignty to the city , and now it should shore up that sovereignty , she said .
& nbsp ;
To not recognize this reality , she said , is to & ldquo ; put one & rsquo ; s head in the sand .& rdquo ;
