On Monday , May 13 , sirens will sound again in observance of Yom Hazikaron , Israel & rsquo ; s Remembrance Day for the fallen soldiers and victims of terror , reopening the wounds of the thousands who are reeling in the aftermath of the horrific October 7 massacre and ongoing war with Hamas . For Shira Mark - Harif , this day symbolizes the endless cycle of loss and pain that she has endured for more than eight years . Support Israel & rsquo ; s terror victims & gt ;& gt ; In 2016 , at the age of 24 , Shira was a new mother of two living in Har Hevron , surrounded by her large , enveloping family , 9 siblings and loving parents , when her entire world came crashing down . On July 1 , 2016 , Shira & rsquo ; s father , Rabbi Miki Mark was driving his car along Route 60 , along with his wife and two of his children , when terrorists opened fire , killing Miki and injuring Shira & rsquo ; s mother and two siblings .& nbsp ; Her mother suffered extensive brain damage , leaving Shira , the second oldest child , to assume the role of the primary guardian for her younger four siblings . With her life shattered and faced with the impossible task of now caring for six children , along with her mother , Shira began to lose herself .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;& ldquo ; My father was my entire world , but because I was over the age of 21 , I fell through the cracks ,& rdquo ; Shira shares , just ahead of Yom Hazikaron , adding that aside from basic support as a foster parent and emotional therapy , she was not entitled to any other support from the Israeli government , & ldquo ; It was through the support of OneFamily that I felt that there was somebody to check on me , to feel connection and that community has helped me build strong lifelong friendships .& rdquo ; Founded in 2001 by Marc and Chantal Belzberg and inspired by their daughter after the Sbarro Suicide Bombing , OneFamily steps up where others do not bring together Israel & rsquo ; s victims of terror into one , national , self - supportive family . For Shira , like the more than 7 , 200 families supported by the organization since 2001 , it helped her find herself again .& nbsp ;& nbsp ; Support Israel & rsquo ; s terror victims & gt ;& gt ; Understanding the emotional complexities of the families of the victims of terror , OneFamily took the initiative to gradually reach out to Shira and her siblings , first attending the shiva of her father , and then over time developing a budding relationship that has turned into the central force that has allowed the Mark family to continue living .& ldquo ; At first , it is just chaos ,& rdquo ; she recalls . & ldquo ; I had no idea what I needed , but OneFamily continued to reach out and provide us with everything we needed .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; My mother and I began to attend ceramics classes in Jerusalem and group activities with other families of victims of terror ,& rdquo ; Shira explains , adding that her mother continues to travel two hours to Jerusalem from their new home in the Golan Heights each week just so she does not miss a single ceramics class . & ldquo ; They truly see you , and give us strength , the ability to breath and a connection with the larger community .& rdquo ; But unfathomable tragedy struck again , just two and a half years after the death of her father , as Shira & rsquo ; s oldest brother , Shlomi , was killed in a traffic accident while on his way to work at the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s office in 2019 .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;& nbsp ;& ldquo ; The hardest part is how everything in my life fell apart , slowly got back together , and then fell apart again .& nbsp ; Even when you are surrounded by family in mourning , you still feel alone . There is something freeing about being with others who have experienced similar pain ,& rdquo ; Shira explains , still smiling in the face of unimaginable tragedy through the support she has continued to receive through OneFamily over the course of eight years ,& nbsp ;& ldquo ; For my younger sisters and the children of my brother , OneFamily has been the most impactful thing in their lives ,& rdquo ; she says . & ldquo ; They have so much support and have made so many friends , attending summer camps and shabbatons , and I know that this is a place where they can share things that they cannot share anywhere else .& nbsp ; It is like a home , a place you can always count on .& rdquo ; In the days following the October 7 attacks , Shira & rsquo ; s shared pain compelled her to take her professional experience as a clinical social worker to support the community of Kibbutz Kfar Aza , only to find her life torn apart yet again as her younger brother , Pedayah , a platoon commander with the Givati Brigade , was killed in a rocket explosion in Gaza on October 31 . Support Israel & rsquo ; s terror victims & gt ;& gt ;& ldquo ; Maybe it is because I have spent so many years in mourning , but I could recognize myself within all this ,& rdquo ; Shira says .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; Last week , I cried for days , but I know that it is OK too ,& rdquo ; Shira adds of OneFamily & rsquo ; s annual Remembrance Day Ceremony , which will take place May 12 in Jerusalem & rsquo ; s International Convention Center to a sold - out audience . Shira , who will be one of the featured speakers , shares that each year OneFamily community members have a tradition of sitting together with a beer , as they laugh and cry , comfort each other and provide a safe space to process their complex emotions , as Remembrance Day reopens the fresh wounds felt by millions around the world .& nbsp ;& nbsp ; While OneFamily has created a model for national support in the face of terrorism , a stark reality that many Western countries do not share , more than 60 , 000 Israelis have joined the list of victims of terror will statistically leave thousands to fall through the cracks , just as Shira would have without the immediate response of the organization .& nbsp ; This article was written in cooperation with OneFamily .& nbsp ;
