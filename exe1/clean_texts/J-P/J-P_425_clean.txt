Chanting & ldquo ; America is the head of the snake ,& rdquo ; the protesters said they were opposed to & ldquo ; receiving the enemies of the Palestinian people on our land .& rdquo ; They also chanted : & ldquo ; Our people want the [ rocket - propelled grenade ] RPG .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Some protesters carried placards reading : & ldquo ; Blinken , you are not welcome !& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The protesters also denounced the security coordination between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank . & ldquo ; Security coordination is shameful ,& rdquo ; the Palestinians chanted . & ldquo ; The Olso Accords are gone .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Blinken & rsquo ; s visit is the masquerade of politics and bad - will diplomacy in an attempt to fragment our unified struggle and further entrench a settler colonial and capitalist agenda that strikes at the trenches of the liberation movement ,& rdquo ; a spokeswoman for the protesters said in a statement .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We reject the imposition of the US to broker false negotiations between our colonizers and the defunct and corrupt leadership in Ramallah .& rdquo ;
