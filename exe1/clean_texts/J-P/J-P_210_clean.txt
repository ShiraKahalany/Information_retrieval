A children @@@ s program called & quot ; A Child and a Refugee Camp & quot ; on Palestinian Authority television interviewed a 12 - year - old Palestinian boy who described wanting to & quot ; return & quot ; to Lod , an Israeli city , in a broadcast in November , according to Palestinian Media Watch ( PMW ).
& nbsp ;
The boy , Abd Al - Rahman Baba , was interviewed by children @@@ s TV host Walaa Al - Battat , who described Lod as one of & quot ; Palestine @@@ s ancient cities .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Jews stole our land from us , and I have been waiting 12 years already , my father 40 years , and my grandfather has been waiting 70 years ,& quot ; said Baba , according to PMW . & quot ; The Jews took our land by force and settled us in the [ refugee ] camps . I hope to return to Lod , my city .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Baba stated on the show that he feels that & quot ; tomorrow [ he ] will return and liberate Palestine .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
& quot ; Every day , every minute , and every year I imagine that I & rsquo ; m in Lod ,& quot ; said the 12 - year - old Palestinian . & quot ; I imagine that I @@@ m playing with my friends , my neighbors , in our backyard . I imagine our home , how it will be ... I imagine the Lod Airport that the occupation [ Israel ] Judaized and called @@@ Ben - Gurion .@@@

& quot ; Of course we will return and live in those houses ,& quot ; he said .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; This is the Palestinian child refugee ,& quot ; said Al - Battat , according to PMW . & quot ; There is no replacement for the Return . Nothing will make them forget the homeland from which they were expelled .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The show featured a map of & quot ; Palestine & quot ; covering all territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River , without the State of Israel .
& nbsp ;
Al - Battat frequently states in children @@@ s shows that Palestinians will & quot ; return to [ their ] land & quot ; and that Israel will come to an end , according to PMW .
