Not many Israeli performers can understand the pressure and glare being hoisted upon them at the Eurovision Song Contest . This year , Israel & rsquo ; s representative , Eden Golan , has the additional burden of being the focus of protests and boycott calls over the Gaza war . One performer who has been there had some prescient advice for the 20 - year - old Golan , who performed in the semi - finals of the competition late Thursday night .& ldquo ; Embrace and cherish the moment ,& rdquo ; said iconic singer Gali Atari , who represented Israel at Eurovision in 1979 as part of Milk and Honey and won with the legendary & ldquo ; Hallelujah .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; She should try and savor this pivotal moment in her life . She stands at the outset of her professional journey , poised to grace this immensely significant international stage as the representative of the State of Israel . I have unwavering confidence in her , and I trust her to represent Israel with utmost dignity ,& rdquo ; Atari said . Wednesday night , as Golan belted out her entry & ldquo ; Hurricane ,& rdquo ; during the dress rehearsal , the tension that pervaded the streets of Malm & ouml ;, Sweden , seeped into the concert hall , casting a shadow over the atmosphere as disgruntled spectators booed and , in some cases , stormed out in protest . Tension in Malm & ouml ;& ldquo ; In any other year , Eden Golan and & lsquo ; Hurricane & rsquo ; would stand a good chance of reaching the top ,& rdquo ; Atari told The Jerusalem Post from Mount Herzl , where the recording of her part in the upcoming torch - lighting ceremony for Independence Day was just taped .& ldquo ; Nevertheless , let & rsquo ; s remain optimistic . Let & rsquo ; s hope and trust that the judges across different nations will prioritize genuine musical evaluation over political distractions ,& rdquo ; she said . Under ordinary circumstances , going onstage at Eurovision can be a daunting experience , the 1979 winner recalled .& ldquo ; Yes , there is tension , there & rsquo ; s some anxiety before going on stage . You only have three minutes and you need everything to be perfect . It is not always easy under normal circumstances ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; And all the noise in the background makes it much more difficult . And this year , with the boos , the violent protests & ndash ; it & rsquo ; s all very frightening , but Eden handles it very well .& rdquo ; Atari was very impressed by Golan & rsquo ; s poise . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s hard to believe she & rsquo ; s only 20 ... and already she is such a diva , such a fantastic performer ,& rdquo ; says Atari . & ldquo ; She knows how to command the stage , she knows how to stand & ndash ; so regal on stage . So I don & rsquo ; t think I need to give her any professional tips . Professionally she & rsquo ; s very mature , she & rsquo ; s an excellent singer . Her song is very good ; both her performance and the song are very much in the trend . The song fits perfectly with successful international songs in this genre .& ldquo ; But she & rsquo ; s in Malm & ouml ; & ndash ; it is maybe the most hostile city to Israel in all of Northern Europe ,& rdquo ; the Eurovision veteran said . & ldquo ; But it seems to me that she is managing things with dignity . I wish her great success .& rdquo ;
