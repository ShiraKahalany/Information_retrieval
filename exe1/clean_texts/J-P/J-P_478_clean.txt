The UN must reinstate the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , after she was dismissed for tweeting dismay at & ldquo ; indiscriminate rocket fire & rdquo ; by Palestinian Islamic Jihad , Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said Sunday . OCHA head Sarah Muscroft tweeted last Monday that she was & ldquo ; relieved to see a ceasefire agreed ending hostilities impacting both Palestinians and Israeli civilians . Such indiscriminate rocket fire of Islamic Jihad provoking Israeli retaliation is condemned . The safety of all civilians is paramount & ndash ; the ceasefire must be upheld .& rdquo ; Under pressure from pro - Palestinian activists who claimed Muscroft was blaming Palestinians for Operation Breaking Dawn , which began with Israeli strikes against an Islamic Jihad cell in Gaza the IDF said was planning to fire anti - tank missiles across the border , the UN staffer deleted her tweet a day later .& ldquo ; One of my previous tweets was ill - informed and I have deleted it ,& rdquo ; Muscroft wrote . & ldquo ; I sincerely apologize for my poor judgment . All civilians & ndash ; everywhere & ndash ; must be able to live in peace .& rdquo ; In a letter to UN Secretary - General Antonio Guterres , Erdan said that firing Muscroft over the tweet & ldquo ; effectively grants the Palestinian players and the local UN staff an & lsquo ; unwritten veto & rsquo ; over UN statements , and stands in clear contradiction with the basic principles of objectivity and neutrality that the UN claims to hold .& rdquo ; The tweet & ldquo ; effectively grants the Palestinian players and the local UN staff an & lsquo ; unwritten veto & rsquo ; over UN statements , and stands in clear contradiction with the basic principles of objectivity and neutrality that the UN claims to hold .& rdquo ; Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan & ldquo ; This represents a clear surrender of the UN to threats and intimidation , and poses a very problematic norm ,& rdquo ; he added . The ambassador pointed out that last year , Matthew Schmale , a representative of UNRWA , the UN agency for Palestinian refugees , said in a televised interview that & ldquo ; there is a huge sophistication in the way the Israeli military struck over the last 11 days ,& rdquo ; to try to avoid civilian casualties . Following a Palestinian backlash , Schmale apologized and was recalled from his post . At the same time , Erdan recalled , Miloon Kothari , a member of the UN Human Rights Council & rsquo ; s Commission of Inquiry on Israel said , & ldquo ; We are very disheartened by the social media that is controlled largely by & ndash ; whether it is the Jewish lobby or specific NGOs .& rdquo ; Erdan said Kothari & rsquo ; s comments were & ldquo ; a clear case in which a UN official who clearly breached the principles of impartiality and neutrality required from a member of an HRC Commission of Inquiry used clear antisemitic vicious parlance , and yet still maintains his position .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; Kothari & rsquo ; s interview ... should have been met with a firm response that would have led to his resignation ,& rdquo ; Erdan wrote . & ldquo ; While Israel supports constructive engagement with UN officials and agencies , we cannot accept such blatant double standards .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; While Israel supports constructive engagement with UN officials and agencies , we cannot accept such blatant double standards .& rdquo ; Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad ErdanKothari apologized for his statement earlier this month after UNHRC President Federico Villegas called on him to do so and at least 18 countries , including the US , plus the European Union and Guterres & rsquo ; s office , called his remarks antisemitic .
