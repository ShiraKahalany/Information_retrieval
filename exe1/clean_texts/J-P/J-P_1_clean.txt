This week , a number of voices , many of them linked to Israel & rsquo ; s former ruling Likud Party , claimed that the Mughrabi bridge , which links the Temple Mount to an area near the Western Wall and is used by non - Muslims to visit the Temple Mount , is in danger of collapse . Former transportation minister MK Miri Regev said & ldquo ; it is forbidden to wait another moment with the demolition of the bridge and the construction of an appropriate replacement .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
The concerns about the bridge ostensibly date from a month ago when an engineer & rsquo ; s report said that the wood the bridge was constructed with does not enable safe use of the bridge . This raises questions about why the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu didn & rsquo ; t replace or reinforce the bridge recently , despite being in office for a decade . 

How did a bridge suddenly become unsafe around the same time Israel got a new government ? Why is there now a new potential crisis at the sensitive holy site ? Did the crisis emerge precisely when the Kingdom of Jordan and Israel are working to repair ties ? 

Jordan is sensitive to any changes to the status quo and previous attempts to alter the bridge have met with protests and also conspiracies spreading about al - Aqsa being in danger . These kinds of conspiracies have led to conflict in the past , including the recent Gaza war .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
So how did we get here ? In 2011 , a temporary structure , often called the Mughrabi bridge after an early ramp and neighborhood that once existed underneath the temporary bridge , was closed due to safety concerns . At the time , reports said that & ldquo ; officials closed the Mugrabi Bridge on Sunday , three days before the municipality deadline to close the ramp leading from the Western Wall plaza to the Temple Mount . The Jerusalem city engineer , Shlomo Eshkol , has warned over the past year in a series of letters to the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation & ndash ; which oversees the area & ndash ; that the temporary bridge is unsafe .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Let & rsquo ; s recall what happened at the time , 10 years ago . & ldquo ; The municipality originally set November 28 , 2011 as the deadline to destroy the bridge , but ... Netanyahu intervened to stop the demolition , worried about triggering riots across the Arab world . In the most recent letter , sent last week , the municipality insisted the entrance must be closed to the public until a new bridge is built .& rdquo ;

Netanyahu chose to cancel the demolition of the bridge because of concerns in Egypt and Jordan . The Jerusalem Municipality tried to close the structure on December 12 .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Oddly the issue then disappeared from the headlines . Somehow , the unsafe bridge continued to exist with some modifications . In 2014 , a new report emerged . A new part of the bridge had been added . & ldquo ; Erected less than two weeks ago , the bridge had not officially been opened when ... Netanyahu ordered it be dismantled after it became clear that the project was not approved by the relevant authorities , and amid mounting Jordanian protests .& rdquo ; Once again , the temporary bridge , erected after the ramp collapsed partially in 2004 , had become permanent and any changes were seen as a & ldquo ; status quo & rdquo ; issue threatening peace in the region .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
It appears that in 2011 and 2014 the Netanyahu government chose to forego changes in order to maintain calm . Now , suddenly , there are calls to remove the bridge by members of the same party that didn & rsquo ; t remove it for a decade . This , despite the fact that it is well known that previous changes have always resulted in a crisis . Is this controversy about the bridge or creating stumbling block for the new government in ties with Jordan ? Jordan & rsquo ; s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has met his Israeli counterpart in what the Jordan Times calls a & ldquo ; semblance of normality .& rdquo ; There is a new deal to supply Jordan with water . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been outspoken on the importance of ties with Jordan .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
For Netanyahu , the Kingdom of Jordan was always a sour point . He ran into many controversies with the kingdom dating back to his time in office in the 1990s . Netanyahu didn & rsquo ; t make progress on the plans to develop the Arava peace valley with Jordan , and Jordan harshly slammed Israel during the 25 - year anniversary of the peace agreement between the countries , demanding Israel return lands that were part of the agreement . In 2017 , an incident with an Israeli security guard in Jordan , in which two Jordanians were killed , led to another crisis . Most recently , Netanyahu canceled a short trip to the UAE on the eve of elections after a stop in Jordan apparently was nixed . In addition Jordan & rsquo ; s crown prince canceled a trip to Jerusalem in March . Relations were at their lowest point in memory .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Netanyahu has slammed Jordan in recent days , critiquing the water deal and accusing Jordan of having ties to Iran . The insinuation was that Jordan had transported oil from Iraq to Egypt and that somehow , this helps Iran .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
It is in this context that there are rising calls for the government to make changes to the Mughrabi bridge . Any chances are likely to cause a crisis . Closing the bridge would anger some of the Jews who visit the Temple Mount weekly . It would also mean non - Muslims could not visit the historic area near the mosque and Dome of the Rock . Any changes to the bridge would lead to complaints from Jordan unless there was coordination .& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
There is no doubt the bridge needs to be safe , both for those who use it and because it stretches over a part of the women & rsquo ; s section of the Western Wall . There are many questions to be asked why this bridge issue was never responsibly addressed for more than a decade . It appears convenient that suddenly those who were in office for many years and made no changes now want it closed , demolished , changed or removed . 

Like many things that took place over the last decade in Israel where problems were managed , or what some call & ldquo ; mowing the grass ,& rdquo ; was done to postpone addressing major issues . The bridge is a symbol of how Jerusalem and Israel were managed . This crisis management meant postponing many major problems , such as dealing with Gaza & rsquo ; s constant crises , to the issues facing Bedouin in the Negev , to ignoring the crowding at Meron that led to a disaster , and then not investigating it . 

The current government wants to address the issues , but stoking up issues like the Mughrabi bridge appears to be a way to create a crisis with Jordan precisely when Jordan and Israel are keen on working together again . Whether the kingdom might be interested in being flexible regarding the bridge might be address , but such status quo issues usually take time and are sensitive because of the position of the Palestinians and the Wakf and other authorities and stakeholders . The King of Jordan is meeting the US president on July 19 . Perhaps responsible policies regarding the bridge will prevail .& nbsp ; & nbsp ;
