Foreign Ministry representatives refused to meet with European Union Special Representative for the Middle East Peace Process Sven Koopmans during his recent visit to the region , a diplomatic source confirmed on Wednesday .
& nbsp ;
Israel snubbed Koopmans because of & ldquo ; dissatisfaction & rdquo ; with EU High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell & rsquo ; s statements during Operation Guardian of the Walls .
& nbsp ;
Among the statements Israel found to be problematic were Borrell & rsquo ; s call for & ldquo ; the immediate cessation of all violence and the implementation of a ceasefire ,& rdquo ; when Gazan terrorists & rsquo ; rockets were still raining on Israel ; claims that Israel used disproportionate force ; and that there was an & ldquo ; unacceptable number of civilian casualties .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
In addition , Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi disputed Borrell & rsquo ; s claim that Hungary was the only one out of 27 EU member states to oppose a statement reflecting the EU commissioner & rsquo ; s views .
& nbsp ;
A European official responded that Borrell & rsquo ; s statements , as well as those by European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen , all reaffirmed Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself and condemned Hamas targeting civilians .
& nbsp ;
In addition , the official said that only one foreign minister & ndash ; P & eacute ; ter Szijj & aacute ; rt & oacute ; of Hungary & ndash ; opposed Borrell & rsquo ; s call for an immediate ceasefire .
& nbsp ;
Koopmans updated Ambassador to EU Institutions Aharon Leshno - Yaar before his visit , and after consulting with Jerusalem , the ambassador recommended that Koopmans come at a later date , Walla reported .
& nbsp ;
The special envoy arrived in Israel late last month , disregarding the Foreign Ministry & rsquo ; s position . Koopmans & rsquo ; Twitter feed shows that he met with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh in Ramallah last week .
& nbsp ;
Koopmans also met with residents of Ashkelon , where he found & ldquo ; inspiring young people who lived through great fear , yet have high hopes for the future and genuine interest in meeting their Gaza neighbors . We owe all of them lasting peace and security .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
He also met with young people in Gaza , and wrote a similar tweet about them .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; During my first official visit I spoke with many victims and saw much current and expected suffering . But I also gained the belief that sustainable peace is possible . Leaders must consider the legitimate interests of all peoples and international envoys should dare to help ,& rdquo ; Koopmans wrote this week .
