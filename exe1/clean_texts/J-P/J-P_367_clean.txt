Hamas has been dealt a heavy blow after severely miscalculating the Israeli response to its rocket attacks , analysts believe .

Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have so far lobbed nearly 4 , 000 rockets from Gaza into Israeli territory in less than two weeks . Israel & rsquo ; s Iron Dome missile defense system has successfully managed to intercept the majority of these in midair .
& nbsp ;
Nevertheless , 12 Israelis have been killed and hundreds more injured .
& nbsp ;
On the Palestinian side , some 219 people have been killed in the ongoing flare - up , according to Gaza & rsquo ; s health ministry . Of those , Israel has said that at least 150 were combatants .
& nbsp ;
According to Dr . Harel Chorev , an expert on Palestinian affairs and head of the Network Analysis Desk at Tel Aviv University & rsquo ; s Moshe Dayan Center , Hamas has suffered significant losses during this round of fighting . & ldquo ; Hamas lost in every strategic calculation : Many of their tunnels in the Strip are destroyed and their maritime forces are also paralyzed ,& rdquo ; Chorev told The Media Line .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Since the damage is very high , this will be a lesson that Hamas will take into account . Unlike in 2014 [ during ] Operation Protective Edge , they were not ready .& rdquo ;

Israel pummelled a network of underground tunnels in the Palestinian enclave that were being used to hide rockets and launchers . IDF spokesperson Brig . Gen . Hadai Zilberman on Wednesday said that Israeli Air Force planes had targeted 15 km ( roughly 9 miles ) of tunnels , dropping 122 bombs on the southern Gaza Strip overnight on Tuesday .
& nbsp ;
When Hamas initially began launching rockets into Israel last week , they mistakenly believed that the fighting would only last a day or two , Chorev said . & ldquo ; It will be very hard for them to recover their underground infrastructure ,& rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo ; They thought that it would be inconvenient for [ Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin ] Netanyahu to attack now , which is quite the opposite . It was quite good for him , politically .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas & rsquo ; ongoing strategy , he added , relies on a combination of guerrilla tactics and more traditional military weaponry like rockets and mortars . While Israel has been mostly successful at countering the group & rsquo ; s rockets and has efficiently targeted fighters in Gaza without needing to send in ground forces , Hamas has also notched a few surprising victories of its own . Namely , in helping to stoke the
divisions between Arab and Jewish Israelis across Israel . The rioting and unrest recently seen in several towns and cities , Chorev argued , & ldquo ; is the main asset of Hamas and they are totally surprised by it and trying to inflame [ the situation ] more and more .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Islamist group , which runs the Gaza Strip , has also managed to score a few points in other key strategic areas , including undermining the Palestinian Authority , which recently called off general elections in the West Bank . 

In addition , they succeeded in putting the international spotlight on the Palestinian issue . 

In terms of firepower , Hamas has also advanced , according to a former Israeli counterterrorism chief . & ldquo ; Naturally , when the pace of [ rocket launches ] is greater and the warhead is larger , then the damage is more significant ,& rdquo ; Brig . Gen . ( Res ) Nitzan Nuriel , a fellow at the International Institute for Counter - Terrorism at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya , told The Media Line .
& nbsp ;
Nuriel , a former director of Israel & rsquo ; s Counter - Terrorism Bureau , pointed to Hamas recently devising a system that can launch multiple rockets at a time .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Their missile capabilities & ndash ; from the size to the range and the warhead dimensions & ndash ; in all of these areas Hamas has improved ,& rdquo ; Nuriel said . & ldquo ; They & rsquo ; ve improved thanks to Iranian know - how as well as through experimentation .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Many of the materials the group uses to manufacture their weapons come through the Rafah Border Crossing , located between Egypt and the Gaza Strip . Some of these are standard construction materials , like pipes . & ldquo ; The Egyptian system is not as hermetically sealed as our [ blockade ] is , so I am guessing that Hamas is managing to smuggle in materials through the Rafah crossing ,& rdquo ; Nuriel said . & ldquo ; Ten percent of the pipes entering the Strip are turned into rockets or else the metal is melted down in order to be recast into a relevant shape .& rdquo ;
