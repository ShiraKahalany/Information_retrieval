Our ranks have been emptied and we need to fill them ." According to Yehoshua , " There are 6 , 400 patients in the rehabilitation wing . That ' s why we need the ultra - Orthodox . Those reservists will be able to train the ultra - Orthodox for combat at the Rifleman 03 level ( basic training ). They can then help secure the settlements , similar to the concept of shift work . This is the situation , and we will have to be flexible . There are positions that need to be filled in the ranks with required qualifications , and the ultra - Orthodox can fill in these deficiencies ."
