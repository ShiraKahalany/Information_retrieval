Sailing while under the influence ? Not in Israel . A proposed bill to prohibit operating watercraft such as boats when drunk was approved Wednesday in a preliminary vote by the Knesset . No under the sea & nbsp ; Under the bill , which will go next to a committee for discussion , it will be prohibited to sail on a jet ski , operate a boat , or steer a watercraft under the influence of alcohol or dangerous substances . The bill would authorize Israel Police to take breath , saliva , or blood samples from a person operating a watercraft . Boating under the influence will be considered a criminal offense punishable by five years in prison . The proposal comes in response to a rise in serious boating accidents that have occurred in Israel , with one of the individuals involved being intoxicated . Additionally , many developed countries worldwide have similar laws prohibiting boating under the influence . In Israel , a law prohibits operating watercraft under the influence of certain substances , although a broader law on the matter is needed .& nbsp ;
