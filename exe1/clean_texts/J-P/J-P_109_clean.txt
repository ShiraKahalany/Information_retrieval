& nbsp ; On Wednesday , the US - Israel relationship seemed , well , normal . The US was supporting Israel in the ways it always has in the repeated confrontations with Hamas since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 .
& nbsp ;
The US blocked the United Nations Security Council from making a statement that was critical of Israel .
& nbsp ;
US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , & ldquo ; condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas ... [ and ] conveyed his unwavering support for Israel & rsquo ; s security and for Israel & rsquo ; s legitimate right to defend itself , while protecting civilians .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that & ldquo ; there is a very clear and absolute distinction between the terrorist organization Hamas that is indiscriminately raining down rockets targeting civilians , and Israel & rsquo ; s response defending itself , targeting the terrorists raining down rockets on Israel .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Blinken dispatched Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr to Israel to help in the de - escalation efforts .
& nbsp ;
But all that happened on Wednesday , three days after Hamas shot rockets into Jerusalem and five days after a serious uptick in violence in Jerusalem . These are short amounts of time in the grand scheme of things , but a long time in terms of an escalation .
& nbsp ;
The night before that , at the very same time that Hamas shot 150 rockets into Tel Aviv and central Israel , sending millions of Israelis into bomb shelters , the Biden administration & rsquo ; s spokespeople synced up on a & ldquo ; both sides & rdquo ; message , despite one side being Israel , a US ally and a democracy , and the other being Hamas , designated by the US as a terrorist organization .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We condemn ongoing rocket attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups , including against Jerusalem . We also stand against extremism that has inflicted violence on both communities ,& rdquo ; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said .
& nbsp ;
Psaki soon moved on to adopt the Palestinians & rsquo ; narrative that this is about the Sheikh Jarrah / Shimon Hatzadik land dispute & ndash ; the ruling on which has yet to be made , and whose residents have not actually been evicted & ndash ; rather than taking in the context of rising Palestinian and Arab violence for the past month .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measures of freedom , security , dignity , and prosperity ,& rdquo ; Psaki said . & ldquo ; And US officials , in recent weeks , have spoken candidly with Israeli officials about how evictions of Palestinian families who have lived for years , sometimes decades , in their homes and of demolitions of these homes work against our common interests in achieving a solution to the conflict .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Similarly , State Department spokesman Ned Price said minutes earlier that & ldquo ; Israel has the right to defend itself and to respond to rocket attacks . The Palestinian people also have the right to safety and security , just as Israelis do .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We are also deeply concerned about the reported loss of life in Gaza and Israel , including the deaths of children as well as many innocent civilians injured . Similarly , in Jerusalem , where there reportedly have been hundreds of Palestinians injured , as well as Israeli police , we call on all sides to exercise restraint and to exercise calm .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Emerging from bomb shelters soon after those statements were made , the Israelis paying attention to Psaki and Price may have scratched their heads as to why Israel & rsquo ; s greatest ally was lecturing them while they were rushing their families to safety from rockets launched indiscriminately at civilians by a terrorist organization .
& nbsp ;
Over the past week , the Biden administration & rsquo ; s messages also focused on & ldquo ; de - escalation .& rdquo ; They & rsquo ; re engaging at all levels , officials and spokespeople said , to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to de - escalate . Pushed by journalists in numerous press briefings to explain what that means , what they & rsquo ; re actually doing to bring the sides away from the brink of war , the members and representatives of the administration didn & rsquo ; t have much to say .
& nbsp ;
MORE THAN one senior Israeli official said they & rsquo ; re satisfied with the US position , pointing to statements by Biden and Blinken , as well as another by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan , as & ldquo ; very supportive ,& rdquo ; as well as to American efforts in the UN to block the statement against Israel .
& nbsp ;
In other words , the things that they are doing , on a practical level , are supportive of Israel , and they are keeping Israel in the loop , as an ally would be expected to do .
& nbsp ;
Israeli officials also said they don & rsquo ; t feel that the US is pressuring them to stop the operation in Gaza , another clear sign of support .
& nbsp ;
But one of those Israeli officials also said that they & ldquo ; don & rsquo ; t have a clue .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
For four months , the Biden administration made Israel and the Palestinians a low priority .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; They didn & rsquo ; t even think about Gaza and Hamas ,& rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo ; When the Palestinian election came up , they didn & rsquo ; t know how to handle it . Elections are a democratic value , but Hamas could be elected , so they played the same game Israel did . They didn & rsquo ; t oppose it publicly , but they sent messages they won & rsquo ; t be mad if it & rsquo ; s postponed .... And now Hamas is frustrated .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
On the one hand , the Biden administration & ndash ; from Blinken and Sullivan to Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas - Greenfield to State Department officials & ndash ; really is constantly in contact with Israelis , as its members have been saying in their statements and briefings .
& nbsp ;
On the other , the administration has been fixated on Jerusalem , the Temple Mount and Sheikh Jarrah in private conversations , accepting the Palestinian narrative on the events .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Nothing changed on the Temple Mount , except that Hamas is trying to present itself as defending the holy places , like Arafat did in 2000 .... Hamas is frustrated that the Palestinian Authority postponed the election , thought it would strengthen them , and now they & rsquo ; re trying to build themselves up . The narrative that Jerusalem is the real problem is that of our opponents ,& rdquo ; the Israeli official said .
& nbsp ;
Israeli officials have found themselves being asked by members of the Biden administration to stop a possible Supreme Court ruling to evict four Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t even understand the argument ,& rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re a democracy . We did the maximum to postpone the ruling , but we don & rsquo ; t control the courts . It & rsquo ; s the same court that evicts settlers .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
As for complaints about Israel using stun grenades in the al - Aksa Mosque , the official pointed out that Israeli police do not use guns at the holy site , but that people throwing boulders at worshipers at the Western Wall and Molotov cocktails at police cannot be given immunity just because they use a mosque as a launching pad .
& nbsp ;
An Israeli official also expressed concern that the Biden administration is more supportive in private conversations than in public statements .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; They used to say that Israel doesn & rsquo ; t have foreign policy , only domestic politics . Our feeling is they & rsquo ; re constantly looking at the left - wing extremes [ of the Democratic Party ] that are against us and their pressure on them ,& rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo ; They & rsquo ; re putting Jerusalem in all their messages , even though it & rsquo ; s not really connected , and then they talk about the need for restraint on both sides .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
In a way , it seemed like the administration was caught off guard when the violence spiraled .
& nbsp ;
Some have argued that the government in Jerusalem did not take the potential for a conflagration seriously enough , and Israel will have to reckon with how its leadership vacuum left it unprepared . That may have colored Washington & rsquo ; s initial reaction .
& nbsp ;
But it didn & rsquo ; t have to be that way . UAE - based news site The National said that & ldquo ; Washington began to pay attention to messages from Arab governments only last week ,& rdquo ; after weeks of warnings that a crisis was brewing in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
Shira Efron , a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , also noted the & ldquo ; bifurcated message & rdquo ; coming from the Biden administration , with messages that create an equivalence between Israel and its enemies , while also saying & ldquo ; this is a just fight , Hamas is a cruel terrorist organization and Israel should fight back .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Reading between the lines , Efron said she thinks the Biden administration is & ldquo ; saying Israel has got it ; they can handle it . I don & rsquo ; t see them actively working to de - escalate .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Even Amr & rsquo ; s visit may be largely symbolic , because , as Efron pointed out , the US doesn & rsquo ; t speak with Hamas . At most , Amr can work with other mediators that do speak with Hamas , like Turkey , Qatar or Egypt , and then relay messages to Israel .
& nbsp ;
Efron questioned whether the Biden administration has & ldquo ; a road map for de - escalation .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
She noted the Biden administration has de - emphasized the Israeli - Palestinian conflict : & ldquo ; They have bigger fish to fry , like China or climate change , but the fact is that there is no assistant secretary for Near East affairs , and there is no ambassador here .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Even the most competent and well - meaning person & ndash ; and I think [ Amr ] does mean well & ndash ; cannot do this on his own ,& rdquo ; Efron said . & ldquo ; He has no staff , and I don & rsquo ; t think this is a priority issue & rdquo ; for the Biden administration .
& nbsp ;
If the latest events are a wake - up call for the administration , it still cannot immediately solve its lack of preparation for a crisis in the region , Efron said . It will take time for Congress to confirm presidential appointments .
& nbsp ;
THE TONE from Washington would have been drastically different if former president Donald Trump were still in office , but Efron pushed back against the argument that there would be significant changes on the ground .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think this has much to do with the US approach . Biden said they & rsquo ; re going to go back to a more traditional approach , but the fact is that not much has changed . It hasn & rsquo ; t been transformational ; it & rsquo ; s not like the Palestinians are now welcome in Washington with a PLO mission ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
Rather , Efron argued , between Ramadan , COVID - 19 frustrations and the cancellation of the Palestinian election , violence against Israel was a & ldquo ; win - win & rdquo ; for Hamas , and the US reaction was unlikely to be a primary or even secondary consideration .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; In 2009 , 2012 and 2014 , there were lengthy IDF operations where we had a US that was more active in favor of the Palestinians , and that didn & rsquo ; t help either ,& rdquo ; she said .
& nbsp ;
Prof . Eytan Gilboa of Bar - Ilan University , however , argued that Trump would have more full - throatedly condemned Hamas and Islamic Jihad , and that would have had a palpable impact .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Trump punished the Palestinians . Biden is trying to appease them . So I think there would have been a different story if Trump had been in the White House , in terms of opposing and condemning Islamic Jihad and Hamas and supporting Israel more ,& rdquo ; he said .
& nbsp ;
Israel & rsquo ; s strategy , Gilboa explained , is to punish Hamas and Islamic Jihad severely , which will take time . US statements calling to stop hostilities weakens Israel in pursuit of that strategy .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The American response overall has been timid , disappointing and irrelevant ... saying Palestinians in Gaza have the right for safety and security just as Israelis do ... as if this is a confrontation between equals ,& rdquo ; Gilboa said . & ldquo ; Both sides are called on to reduce hostilities & ndash ; Israel and a terrorist organization designated by the US .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not evenhandedness . It & rsquo ; s stupidity . This inadvertently encourages Hamas and Islamic Jihad to continue ,& rdquo ; he added .
& nbsp ;
Similar to the Israeli official , Gilboa thought the Biden administration has read the situation wrong by focusing on Sheikh Jarrah , which he called & ldquo ; irrelevant .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The main point is Hamas and Islamic Jihad & rsquo ; s goal of turning the West Bank into Gaza , of taking it over .... If you don & rsquo ; t understand that , then your policies will miss the point ,& rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo ; The alumni of the Obama administration seem to have learned nothing . They & rsquo ; re presented as very experienced in foreign policy and national security ; that has yet to be proven .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
By making the Middle East a lower priority , Biden will now learn that & ldquo ; if you run away from the Middle East , the Middle East runs after you ,& rdquo ; Gilboa warned . & ldquo ; The US has to take a position .... It requires fresh thinking , but what I see are old habits .& rdquo ;
