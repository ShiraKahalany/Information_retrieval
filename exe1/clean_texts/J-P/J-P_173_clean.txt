Peled is the officer who taught me to love the Israel Police ," Ben - Gvir said . Significant upheavalFollowing the appointment , the police are expected to undergo a significant upheaval because at least one high official candidate for the position is now expected to announce his retirement from the police , Maariv reported ." Commissioner Peled is the right man to lead the Israel Police . Peled is an officer with rich , professional , and sharp experience . He is a fighter for the country and an administrator who will move the police forward . This is the opportunity to deeply thank the current chief Shabtai , to whom the state owes forty years of service and fighting for the people of Israel ." About a month ago , as I recall , the Meron disaster investigation concluded that Shabtai bears personal responsibility for the disaster ," Ben - Gvir continued . " The findings of the report determined that in Shabtai ' s case , would have led it to recommend the termination of his position , but considering the current circumstances ( Israel - Hamas war ), It leaves the government to determine the correct date for the end of his position ."
