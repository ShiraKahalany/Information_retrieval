Palestinian children @@@ s program , The Best Home , which airs on Offical PA TV , told its viewers that Israel is & quot ; deliberately killing & quot ; Palestinian children , according to a Palestinian Media Watch report .

Viewers of the program would typically still be within the K - 12 schooling years . Previous airings of the show have featured children within their teens participating discussions , poetry readings , etc .

The presenter , in this episode , seems to be standing in front of a background displaying a rudimentary toy train , suitable for young children .

& quot ; Unfortunately & ndash ; and this is a very painful thing that I want to tell you about & ndash ; a number of friends have lost their right to live because the occupation is deliberately killing the Palestinian children , and this is a very painful thing ,& rdquo ; said host of the program Walaa Al - Battat .



The program presenter went on to explain that Israel participates in the practice of & quot ; random summary executions ,& quot ; claiming that Palestinian children have nowhere to run and that they are in & quot ; danger at every moment .& quot ;

& quot ; Every one of them & ndash ; on the road or at home & ndash ; is a candidate to be the next martyr ,& quot ; Al - Battat added .

In 2015 , Al - Battat voiced similar rhetoric , where she went on to claim that & quot ; the occupation [ Israel ] targets children everywhere ,& quot ; whether it be in their homes or schools , adding that Israeli security forces act in a & quot ; barbaric terrorist way .& quot ; This was voiced during a wave of stabbing attacks on Israeli citizens by Palestinian terrorists .

& quot ; They are trying to kill people everywhere . These are barbarians , my young friends ,& quot ; Al - Battat said , according to the report . & quot ; They try to kill people for no reason , who are just walking on their land . They make various accusations against them . This is called barbarity , my friends .& quot ; 

The 2015 message addressed all Palestinian children under the age of 15 , with a separate message to those under 18 . 

& quot ; Be very careful all the time ,& quot ; she added to her 2015 statement . & quot ; All children under 18 , and children under 15 , when you go out , your mom or dad , should accompany you , I mean that an adult should accompany you .& quot ;
