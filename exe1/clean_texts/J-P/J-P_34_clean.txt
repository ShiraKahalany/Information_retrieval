With tensions rising with Iran , Israel is concerned that the Islamic Republic could deploy up to 200 long - range missiles in Iraq that could be used to attack the Jewish state . Iran is already believed to have hundreds of missiles that can reach Israel .
& nbsp ;
While the chances of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran are deemed low , heightened tensions in the North amid the possibility of a confrontation in Syria or Lebanon , could also draw Iran to retaliate .
& nbsp ;
The rationale for Iran to deploy missiles in Iraq and launch them from there against Israel would be to try and prevent a direct IDF retaliation against targets within Iranian territory .
& nbsp ;
Israel has reportedly upped its attacks against Iranian infrastructure in Syria in recent weeks . On Monday morning , Israeli Air Force aircraft reportedly struck targets near Damascus , the second such strike within a week .
& nbsp ;
The airstrike came just as a surprise military drill covering Israel & rsquo ; s entire northern region was announced . Dubbed & quot ; Vered Hagalil & quot ;, the massive aerial drill , which started on Monday , was launched to help prepare the IAF for a future war with Hezbollah .
& nbsp ;
Israel does not currently believe that Hezbollah is interested in a new war , but military intelligence is of the opinion that there is a relatively high chance for a & ldquo ; few days of combat & rdquo ; between the IDF and the Iranian - backed guerilla organization .
& nbsp ;
This is believed to be the result of the group & rsquo ; s failure to avenge the killing of one of its operatives last summer in an airstrike in Syria , attributed to the IAF . An illustration of this was seen two weeks ago when Hezbollah fired a surface - to - air missile at an Israeli drone patrolling southern Lebanon . Had the drone been hit , Israeli officials said that the IDF would have been ordered to respond aggressively .
& nbsp ;
During the Vered Hagalil exercise , increased numbers of fighter jets and helicopters are expected to be noticed across the country , and a number of explosions may be heard in northern Israel . The exercise is said to end on Wednesday .
& nbsp ;
The Vered Hagalil exercise simulates combat scenarios in the northern front , and will test all components in the IAF @@@ s core missions , including maintaining aerial superiority , protecting the country @@@ s skies , as well as attacking and gathering intelligence .
