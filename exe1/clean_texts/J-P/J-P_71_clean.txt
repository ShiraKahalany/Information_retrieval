Israel Aerospace Industries ( IAI ) launched its Global Control Center ( GCC ), which can significantly reduce conversion time from passenger aircraft to freight aircraft . The GCC system , developed in - house , can manage and monitor significant projects , notably the international aircraft conversion programs that IAI conducts in Israel and worldwide . It will be managed by an advanced control and monitoring center at IAI & rsquo ; s facility . These conversions have experienced a boom in recent years , with a significant increase in the demand for air freight . Data from 2023 shows a 15 % increase in demand compared to 2022 , according to IAI , and this is expected to continue in the future . IAI CEO Boaz Levy says the company expects the system & ldquo ; will have a great impact on [ its ] activities , both internally and externally , first in the aviation sector and then in other IAI activities .& rdquo ; The system is now in operation after being tested by all levelsThe system is now in operation after being tested by all levels , from aeronautical division managers to project managers and general workers , and it not only reduces conversion time but also optimizes all the logistical processes and allows for a targeted and horizontal management of errors or challenges . According to IAI , the GCC system allows the company to present the conversion process in real - time to its customers , both new and existing , in a way that was not previously possible and with a degree of detail that was until recently considered impossible . IAI has been converting aircraft for years , including the Boeing 737 , the 767 series , the 777 - 300 , and the Airbus A330 aircraft , the last two of which are in the final stages of acquiring a license . VP and GM of IAI & rsquo ; s Aviation Group Shmuel Kuzi explained , & ldquo ; Now that it is in full operation , we expect to be able to reduce the working time on each aircraft , improve the response to our customers , and allow new customers to share in the success and enjoy IAI & rsquo ; s converted freighters .& rdquo ;
