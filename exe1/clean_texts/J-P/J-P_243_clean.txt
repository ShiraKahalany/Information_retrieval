Thousands gathered virtually around the world to commemorate the Jews who were massacred during the Farhud pogrom in 1941 . 
& nbsp ;
The Farhud was a pogrom that took place in Baghdad and Basra on June 1 and 2 of 1941 that culminated in the murder of 180 Jews . During the purge , hundreds were injured and the homes and synagogues within the Jewish communities were looted and burnt to the ground .
& nbsp ;
The ceremony was organized by David Dangoor , who is a businessman and philanthropist who grew up in the Jewish community of Baghdad and now lives in the UK .
& nbsp ;
Considering the recent escalation between Israel and terror groups in the Gaza Strip , Dangoor felt it was especially important to highlight this pogrom to present what happens when antisemitism runs rampant .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Farhud was a tragic event that sounded the death knell for the oldest Jewish Diaspora community , but sadly is not well known around the world ,& rdquo ; said Dangoor . & ldquo ; It is vital that the Jewish world and beyond commemorate the Farhud to understand better how to deal with hate , incitement and violence , and prevent such events from happening in the present and future .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Even up to the very end , many Jews and Arabs in Iraq refused to be enemies and lived and worked side by side ,& quot ; he added . & quot ; Animosity was largely imported from outside and incitement used as a tool for political goals . Unfortunately , we see many similar worrying signs in the violence in Israel , the US and Europe in recent days .& quot ;
& nbsp ;
The commemoration had people across the world lighting virtual candles in honor of the victims of the pogrom . Facebook users also have the opportunity to apply a filter to their profile picture .

Each Shavuot , thousands of Jews from Baghdad remember the traumatic day when 2 , 400 years of Jewish life in Babylon came to an end .
& nbsp ;
Exactly 70 years ago , on the eve of Shavuot , some 700 Jews in the city were murdered in a Nazi - led pogrom known as the Farhud (& ldquo ; violent dispossession & rdquo ; in Arabic ). Inspired by Kristallnacht , it marked the end of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the Diaspora and showed how far Hitler & rsquo ; s hatred of the Jews spread globally during World War II .
& nbsp ;
The Jews of Iraq had been living peacefully in Baghdad since the Babylonian era . By 1941 , they numbered around 150 , 000 , making up over a third of the population .
& nbsp ;
The monarchy in Iraq , installed by the UK , had been overthrown by the lawyer Rashid Ali al - Gaylani in April 1941 , in a violent coup one month before the Farhud .
& nbsp ;
Rashid Ali had strong links to the Nazi Party and the grand mufti , a close ally of Hitler . Rashid Ali indoctrinated the country with Nazi propaganda ; children in Iraqi schools were taught to praise Hitler and that Jews were a treacherous enemy , and Radio Berlin had regular broadcasts in Arabic .
& nbsp ;
Supported by the Nazis , he aimed to rid Iraq of Britain and to gain access to the huge oil reserves in Kirkuk .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
An order was issued to Iraq & rsquo ; s air force to destroy the British RAF base in Habbaniyeh , west of Baghdad .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Although the RAF was only equipped with planes left over from World War I , the bombing campaign failed drastically , with Iraq & rsquo ; s inept air force shooting down several of its own planes .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
On May 30 , Rashid Ali was forced to flee . With British ground troops advancing on Baghdad and with no leader , the Jewish community was left in a perilous position .
& nbsp ;
Two days later , on June 1 , the observant Jewish community was preparing for Shavuot , oblivious to a huge mob of rampaging Muslims shouting , & ldquo ; Cutal al yehud !& rdquo ; ( slaughter the Jews ).
& nbsp ;
With no organized resistance , many of the Jews who survived unscathed bribed Iraqi policemen to stand guard .
& nbsp ;
But the violence worsened during the night , and the mob soon numbered in the tens of thousands , targeting every Jewish home in the city . The mufti had made this task simple by advising the chief rabbi to ask the still - trusting Jewish community to paint a red hamsa ( palm - shaped amulet used as a sign of protection ) on the outside of their homes .
& nbsp ;
While the violence continued unabated , British troops were waiting on the outskirts of the city , forbidden to enter .
& nbsp ;
By the second day of fighting , the mob & rsquo ; s violence had spread to such a degree that Muslim shops were also being looted , and a curfew was eventually called at 5 p . m . Remaining violators on the streets were shot , and a relative calm was soon restored .
& nbsp ;
WHEN THE State of Israel was created , life in Iraq became unbearable , with public hangings of prominent Jews that shocked the community to new depths . When the Iraqi government finally allowed Jews to leave in 1950 on condition that they forfeit their nationality and all their money and property , the entire community registered en masse , leaving only 2 , 000 Jews by 1952 .
