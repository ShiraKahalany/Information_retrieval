Lihi Lapid , whose latest novel , On Her Own , was just published in the US by HarperVia , has a very unusual biography for a writer .& nbsp ; While she is the author of a previous novel , Woman of Valor , which was also published in English to positive reviews , and several other books that came out in Israel , she is known around the world as the wife of Israel & rsquo ; s previous prime minister , Yair Lapid , now head of the opposition .& nbsp ; As we meet in the caf & eacute ; at the Israel Museum , a convenient location for the Tel Aviv - based novelist , who is set to attend a rally to protest the policies of the current government outside the Knesset in a few hours , where her husband will speak , many people recognize her and wish her well .& nbsp ; Lapid acknowledged them gracefully , displaying the poise that she has acquired in a life in the harsh Israeli political spotlight . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m very involved in supporting Yair , not in terms of political decisions , but going out and campaigning ,& rdquo ; she said . Still , it was important to her to keep writing , and she did much of her work & ldquo ; in the twilight zone of the early morning hours ,& rdquo ; during bouts of insomnia . As the well - wishers drifted away , before I could ask a question , she turned to me with one of her own , one that any author would ask : How did I like the book ? My answer , that I thought it was a moving and suspenseful story , filled with beautiful writing and vivid scenes , and that I fell in love with the three complex women at its center , pleased her as if she were a first - time writer , and led me into my first question : Where did she get the idea for it ?& nbsp ; The plot of the novelOn Her Own is about Nina , a teenage girl from Sderot born to Irena , a Ukrainian immigrant and single mother . A smart girl , Nina is nevertheless seduced by Johnny , a smalltime gangster who brings her for trysts to a Tel Aviv hotel .& nbsp ; One night when she is with him there , she witnesses a violent crime he is involved in , and she flees and takes refuge with Carmela .& nbsp ; Carmela is a lonely widow with dementia who has buried one son , a fallen soldier , and whose other son is busy with his family in America . Carmela has moments that are partly dementia and partly wishful thinking when she feels that her late son is still alive . She has also been dreaming that Dana , her granddaughter will come to visit , and when Nina shows up at her door , she foggily embraces the girl , thinking & ndash ; or hoping & ndash ; that she is the grandchild she hasn & rsquo ; t seen in years . Meanwhile , Irena frantically searches for her daughter on the eve of the Passover holiday . She created these characters and told their stories through a complex writing process that took her several years . One inspiration was from a poem by Giora Fisher about a bereaved father with dementia . Lapid quoted the lines : & ldquo ; Don & rsquo ; t tell me , oy , but he & rsquo ; s been gone a long time / Tell me , he just went out and he & rsquo ; ll be back soon .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; For her , this was the & ldquo ; most heartbreaking poem I & rsquo ; ve ever heard .... When I heard that poem , I knew that was the essence of Carmela , that she wants to be in that place where in just a moment , he & rsquo ; ll return .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Nina came to life for her in a more circuitous route , when she imagined a teenage girl who is fleeing from a world of danger who meets Carmela on the stairs . For a long time , she had only vague thoughts about this scene and couldn & rsquo ; t figure out what the rest of the story should be . She spoke with a woman who worked as a counselor at a center run by Elem , for at - risk youth , about how girls like Nina are preyed on by men like Johnny . & ldquo ; And she told me , & lsquo ; It doesn & rsquo ; t happen all at once .& rsquo ;.... Gradually , girls are drawn into this world .& rdquo ; She also spent time speaking to single mothers who were recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union . & ldquo ; One woman I have known for years . She is so talented and so smart , she has two children from different fathers , she gets up early , she works all day in the store so that her children will have a future .& nbsp ; She lives for them .... And she exists almost completely in a Russian - speaking world .& rdquo ; Her brother , Deddy , who lived in the US for decades , was an inspiration for the character , Itamar , Carmela & rsquo ; s son who lives in America . Lapid & rsquo ; s brother passed away from cancer after the book was finished and the book is dedicated to him . & ldquo ; We were very close .... He knew me better than I know myself . He knew I would become a writer before I knew .& rdquo ; Lapid may seem to be the ultimate Tel Aviv insider , and at first , it is surprising that she wrote about characters who live on the margins of society , but as you speak to her more , you begin to understand that she can identify with these characters because she also grew up feeling like an outsider . Born in Arad , a town where & ldquo ; you visit for a minute to get a cup of coffee and to go to the bathroom when the bus stops on the way to Masada ,& rdquo ; she moved with her parents , who ran a Judaica store , to the Tel Aviv area when she was in her teens and struggled to fit in .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; The distance between a place like Sderot or Arad and Tel Aviv can be even longer than the distance between Tel Aviv and New York ,& rdquo ; she noted .& nbsp ; Working as a photojournalist in Tel Aviv after the army , when she first met and then married Yair , she initially felt intimidated by his distinguished family . Yair Lapid was an actor and author at that time , and his father , Tommy Lapid , was a politician and a journalist , while his mother , Shulamit Lapid , is an acclaimed novelist .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; I took literature courses at the university to keep up with them , so I wouldn & rsquo ; t seem like an idiot at their family dinners , where they spoke about literature and art all the time .& rdquo ; She turned to writing after she suffered two miscarriages and was put on bedrest when she was pregnant with her son , Lior , and needed a way to express herself that didn & rsquo ; t involve running around Tel Aviv on a motorcycle with a camera .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; When Lior was born , I understood that no newspaper is looking for a photographer who has to nurse every four hours .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Another way in which Lapid looks at the world differently from how you might expect is that her daughter , Yael , is on the autism spectrum . I have known Lapid slightly for many years because I also have a son on the spectrum the same age as her daughter , and she is the president of SHEKEL , an organization for people with special needs in Israel .& nbsp ; Both of the Lapids have been upfront about their struggles raising their daughter . At first , after Yael & rsquo ; s diagnosis , Lapid was consumed by trying to help her , to the exclusion of everything else . & ldquo ; I was a wreck , I didn & rsquo ; t want to see anyone , I didn & rsquo ; t want to work , I just wanted to save her , I tried to do everything for her .... There was a very dramatic moment , where Yair said to me , & lsquo ; You have other children who need you .& nbsp ; And you have me , and I need you . Yaeli will be who she is for life , she & rsquo ; s not a project for a couple of years , it & rsquo ; s not like she & rsquo ; ll go swimming with dolphins and then everything will be fine .... This has to go back to being a happy home .& rsquo ;& rdquo ; Now , having a special - needs daughter is an important part of who she is , but not her full identity . & ldquo ; I am connected to Yael ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; I will always need to be there for her . But I & rsquo ; m also a writer , I & rsquo ; m also Lior & rsquo ; s mother and Yair & rsquo ; s wife . I & rsquo ; m also a friend .& rdquo ; It was interesting for her to write the sections about Nina and Irena & rsquo ; s relationship , because her relationship with her daughter is very different . & ldquo ; I have a daughter I can & rsquo ; t fight with the way Irena and Nina fight in the book .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; One aspect of the response to her book in Israel that has pleased her is that , & ldquo ; People have said , it & rsquo ; s so Israeli .& rdquo ; Now that it has been published in English , she isn & rsquo ; t afraid that readers in other countries will find it too Israeli and won & rsquo ; t be able to relate to it . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s like reading a book from abroad , a book like The Kite Runner , and it & rsquo ; s wonderful that it gives you an authentic glimpse into another world , a window into the life of someone completely different .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Just before heading off to the rally , she said that since October 7 , she felt that the story of the bereaved mother in the novel was even more relevant . & ldquo ; Every time I see a picture of a soldier who has been killed , I think , there & rsquo ; s another mother like Carmela now , who will miss him for 30 or 40 years , who won & rsquo ; t be able to feel happy for 30 or 40 years .& nbsp ; They are soldiers , but they are also our children .... Now that the book is being published in English , I think people who read it outside of Israel will have a greater understanding of what it means to be Israeli , of the price we pay for our life here , that & rsquo ; s very meaningful to me .& rdquo ;
