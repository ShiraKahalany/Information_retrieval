For the first time in 50 years , Israel no longer enjoys the status of a & ldquo ; liberal democracy & rdquo ; due to & ldquo ; substantial declines in the indicators measuring the transparency and predictability of the law , and government attacks on the judiciary ,& rdquo ; according to the V - Dem Institute & rsquo ; s 2024 Democracy Report . V - Dem , short for Varieties of Democracy , is a research institute based in Sweden that measures the levels of democracy worldwide based on a variety of what it defines as high - level principles of democracy . The institute publishes a yearly democracy report that splits the world & rsquo ; s countries into four categories : Liberal democracies , electoral democracies , electoral autocracies , and closed autocracies . Electoral democracies , according to V - Dem , include & ldquo ; multiparty elections for the executive are free and fair ; satisfactory degrees of suffrage , freedom of expression , freedom of association .& rdquo ; Liberal democracies include the above , as well as & ldquo ; judicial and legislative constraints on the executive along with the protection of civil liberties and equality before the law .& rdquo ; Israel was a liberal democracy since the 1970s , but in 2023 became an electoral democracy , the report said . According to the report , indicators that lowered Israel & rsquo ; s rating included a 2023 Knesset bill & ldquo ; stripping the Supreme Court of the power to invalidate laws , thus undermining checks on executive power .& rdquo ; A bill severely limiting the Supreme Court & rsquo ; s ability to strike down regular laws and completely remove its power to invalidate Basic Laws , indeed passed its first readings in the Knesset , but did not pass into law . Regarding Israel , the report added that & ldquo ; indicators that are in substantive decline also include freedom from torture ,& rdquo ; but did not expand . Yair Golan on Why Israel ' s democracy got downgradedYair Golan , former IDF deputy chief of staff , Meretz MK and current candidate for leadership of the Labor Party , said in response to the report , & ldquo ; A full year of messianic dreams , incessant threats against the judicial system , oppressive legislation , threats against the freedom of the press , harming fundamental rights of demonstration , and appointing ministers who are criminals , led us to lose our ranking as a liberal democracy .& rdquo ;
