The hashtag # Arab_Lives_Matter , alongside its Arabic and Hebrew translations , has been gaining traction on Twitter , Facebook and other social media platforms , targeted at raising awareness of the continual shootings and killings that are plaguing Arab communities in Israel .
& ldquo ; Should have been obvious that ALL lives matter , including Arab lives , but apparently it is not ,& rdquo ; posted Mira Awad , Arab - Israeli singer , actress and songwriter , after three Arab citizens were killed in the previous 24 hours in shootings across the country . & ldquo ; And here we are , yet another murdered Arab citizen of Israel .& rdquo ;


The Abraham Initiatives group , an organization of Jewish and Arab citizens working to create a shared , functioning and integrative society , fashioned a symbol for the movement which many are retweeting . Thousands used the hashtag over the past day , making the term trend on Twitter by Wednesday morning .
& ldquo ; Meretz joins the protest and commits to acting from within the government to stop the lawlessness ,& rdquo ; reads a post by the left - wing party . & ldquo ; We won & rsquo ; t stop until we put an end to this .& rdquo ;
Public Security Minister Omer Bar Lev also tweeted the hashtag .
& ldquo ; Decades of neglect , ignorance and fear of confronting the issues in the Arab communities , along with the assumption that & lsquo ; as long as they & rsquo ; re killing each other , it & rsquo ; s their problem ,& rsquo ;& rdquo ; wrote Bar Lev . & ldquo ; In my first hundred days in office , I have done more to deal with the crime in the Arab sector than has been done in the past several decades .& rdquo ;

עשרות שנים של הזנחה , התעלמות ופחד להיכנס לעובי הקורה של בעיות המגזר הערבי , וההנחה שרווחה ש ״ כל עוד הם הורגים אחד את השני , אז זו בעיה שלהם ״. ב100 ימי הראשונים בתפקיד עשיתי יותר משנעשה בעשרות השנים האחרונות בהתמודדות עם הפשיעה במגזר הערבי . כן , # חיי_ערבים_חשובים # Arab_Lives_Matter & gt ;& gt ;

Likud spokesman Eli Hazan responded to the hashtag trend by posting on social media : & ldquo ; All lives matter .& rdquo ; Other Twitter users used the phrase alongside & ldquo ; Jewish lives matter & rdquo ; in Hebrew , while others responded in fury and used the hashtag in irony or resentment .
& ldquo ; The State of Israel has a responsibility to solve this , but so does the public , including the Arab community and its leaders ,& rdquo ; said Yaya Fink , CEO of Darkenu . Activists of the 420 , 000 - strong community protested this morning in front of the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s office in Tel Aviv , carrying a coffin marked with the words : & ldquo ; A good Arab is a living Arab .& rdquo ; The statement comes to negate a well - known racial slur , & ldquo ; A good Arab is a dead Arab ,& rdquo ; and protests how the Israeli community and leadership seem to choose to be powerless bystanders while the crime rates soar .
& ldquo ; Eighty - eight murder victims from the beginning of the year is an unbelievable number ,& rdquo ; says Fink . & ldquo ; Our country knows how to handle incredibly complex situations , like bringing in the Iranian nuclear archives or demolishing tunnel infrastructures in Gaza . Our country can definitely confiscate the illegal weapons in the Arab community .& rdquo ;

אם אנחנו יודעים להביא את הארכיון של הגרעין האיראני , לתפוס אוניות נשק בלב ים , לחסל את פרויקט המנהור העזתי ולמצוא 6 אסירים נמלטים תוך ימים ספורים , אנחנו יכולים לאסוף את הנשק הבלתי חוקי בחברה הערבית ,# חיי_ערבים_חשובים # ArabLivesMatterזאת היהדות שלי

Darkenu , comprised mostly of Jewish activists but with a growing representation of Arab participants , is joining hands with groups like the Abraham Initiatives as well as student unions to try to raise this issue to the top of the national interest .
& ldquo ; This is where we are tested as a Jewish and democratic state ,& rdquo ; says Fink . & ldquo ; In our attitude toward the minorities living among us . I say this as a religious man as well . We & rsquo ; re certain that if such a thing were to happen in the Jewish community , a lot more resources would have been put forth toward this issue .& rdquo ;
The police announced on Wednesday morning that over 1 , 000 weapons have been confiscated over the past nine months in the northern district .
Still , security forces have been unable to contain or even reduce the wave of shooting incidents , which have reached multiple deaths per week . A volunteer police officer in his 30s was run over Tuesday and died of his wounds ; the driver was arrested and is suspected of murder and attempted murder . Two men were shot to death on the eve of Yom Kippur , in addition to two more on Tuesday .
& ldquo ; Chaos reigns unchecked ,& rdquo ; tweeted Furat Nassar in a video showing a man firing several shots in the air in the middle of a crowded street in Nazareth in broad daylight . & ldquo ; Where are the police ?& rdquo ;

& ldquo ; This is one of the country & rsquo ; s most significant moral tests ,& rdquo ; concluded Fink . & ldquo ; This must be one of the top priorities of the new government .& rdquo ;
