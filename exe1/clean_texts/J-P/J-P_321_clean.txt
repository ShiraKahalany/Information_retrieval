US Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a resolution blocking a $ 735 million weapons sale to Israel on Thursday , mirroring a symbolic action by the House of Representatives in response to conflict between Israel and Gaza @@@ s Hamas leaders .
& quot ; At a moment when US - made bombs are devastating Gaza , and killing women and children , we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a congressional debate ,& quot ; said Sanders , an independent who votes with Democrats .
Democratic President Joe Biden @@@ s administration approved the potential sale of $ 735 million in weapons to Israel this year , and sent it to Congress on May 5 for formal review .
The Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees all backed the sale during an informal review before May 5 . And lawmakers predicted efforts to stop the sale would fail , given traditionally strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate for arms sales to Israel .
Senator Bob Menendez , the Democratic chairman of Senate Foreign Relations , said he would oppose the Sanders resolution . He also said he was not certain that Sanders had filed it within a required 15 - day period .
& quot ; I can @@@ t imagine that passing ,& quot ; Senator Jim Risch , the committee @@@ s top Republican , told reporters .
The clashes have prompted calls from some lawmakers for a more concerted US effort to stop the violence , including Israeli airstrikes that have killed dozens of civilians , most of them Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip .
Sanders , a former candidate for Democratic presidential nomination , said Americans need to take a & quot ; hard look & quot ; at whether the weapons sales fuel conflict between Israel and Palestinians .
His resolution follows a measure introduced by US Representatives Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez , Mark Pocan and Rashida Tlaib , which has at least six other co - sponsors , including some of the most left - leaning Democrats in the House .
