Americans tend to view Israel more positively than the Palestinians in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , though views toward both sides have modestly become more positive in recent years , according to a recent Pew Research Center survey . A favorable opinion toward Israelis among the US public went from 64 % to 67 % between 2019 and 2022 . A favorable view toward Palestinians jumped from 46 % to 52 % in the same period . Unfavorable views have declined from 28 % to 25 % toward Israelis , and 45 % to 40 % for Palestinians . Overall , 42 % view both Israelis and Palestinians favorably while 25 % view just Israelis favorably , 10 % view just Palestinians favorably , and 15 % view both unfavorably . Currently , 48 % of Americans view the current Israeli government favorably and 44 % view it unfavorably . In 2019 , 41 % of Americans viewed the Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu favorably , and 51 % viewed it negatively . Favorable opinions of Palestinian government have jumped from 19 % in 2019 to 28 % in 2022 . However , the majority of Americans ( 63 %) still hold unfavorable views toward the Palestinian government despite an improvement from a negative 71 % in 2019 . Overall , just 18 % view both governments favorably , compared with 29 % who view just the Israeli government favorably , 10 % just the Palestinian government , and 33 % who view both unfavorably . Demographic divideThe numbers change when accounting for age and political affiliation . Older Americans and those who lean toward the Republican Party tend to view Israelis more positively than younger Americans and those inclined towards the Democrats . Among the under 30s , 56 % view Israelis favorably compared with 78 % who are 65 and older . While 46 % aged 50 + view Palestinians favorably , 61 % under 30 do . Republicans seem to hold Israelis in much higher regard , both as people ( 78 %) and as government ( 66 %) than Palestinian people ( 37 %) and government ( 18 %). Democrats , however , tend to incline slightly toward the Palestinians . Around 60 % view Israelis positively and 64 % view Palestinians positively .& nbsp ; On the Israeli and Palestinian governments , the numbers are 34 % and 37 %, respectively . Close to half of all Democrats and Democrat - leaning independents view both Israelis and Palestinians positively . Solving the Israeli - Palestinian conflictWhile American views toward Israel and the Palestinians have warmed since 2019 , the best possible outcome to the conflict itself remains a stumbling block . While 35 % support a two - state solution backed by US diplomacy , 27 % back a one - state solution , though 16 % seem to prefer a government that consists of both Israelis and Palestinians , 10 % prefer one headed by an Israeli government , and 2 % say they want a Palestinian - headed government . Still , 37 % say they are unsure what they want , and 1 % have nothing to say . Here , too , older Americans tend to back a two - state solution , while younger adults are more likely to say they aren & rsquo ; t sure . Evangelical angleOverall , white evangelical Protestants at 28 % are more likely than other Christians to back a one - state solution headed by an Israeli government , while only 6 % of Catholics , non - Evangelical white Protestants and Black Protestants support that solution . White Evangelicals bring religious motives to their views . Fully 70 % of white Evangelicals believe that God gave the Land of Israel to the Jews , compared with 32 % of US Jews who answered a similar question in a 2020 survey . In addition , 86 % of white Evangelicals have favorable views of Israelis while 37 % view Palestinians favorably . Among atheists , agnostics or other irreligious Americans , Israelis and Palestinians tend to be viewed identically positive at 58 % and 59 % respectively . BDSDespite the media - savvy nature of the BDS movement , relatively few Americans even know about it , and fewer support it . According to Pew , 84 % have heard & ldquo ; not much & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; nothing at all & rdquo ; about BDS . Just 5 % have heard something about it and support it , with 2 % strongly supporting it . Interestingly , more Republicans and Republican - leaning independents have heard of BDS than Democrats and Democrat - leaning independents who are more likely to support it .
