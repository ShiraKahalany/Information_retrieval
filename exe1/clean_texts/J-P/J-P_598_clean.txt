The IDF worked hard on Thursday to toughen its positions across northern Gaza to prevent any surprise attacks by Hamas . In 2014 , Hamas violated a number of temporary ceasefires , in some cases successfully surprising and killing IDF soldiers . IDF Chief - of - Staff Lt .- Gen . Herzi Halevi had held a briefing with all major generals , brigadier generals , and colonels involved in Gaza operations on Wednesday to ensure that they would be ready for anything Hamas might try . The IDF also said that Maj . Gen . ( res .) Nitzan Alon had set up a special apparatus near the Gaza border for taking in hostages presuming Hamas follows through with the terms of the war pause .& nbsp ; That apparatus is highly organized both in terms of special medical and psychological staff as well as helicopters and other heavy weaponry to ensure security . IDF enter Hamas ' s ' Grad Valley ,' uncover tunnels and weapons in children ' s bedroomsBesides those developments , due to the war pause being delayed , the IDF continued attacks on Hamas on Thursday in Jabalia and Zeitoun , northeast areas which it only turned its attention to late last week after having already taken over central Gaza City . The IDF said it had found more weapons hidden in children ' s beds , mosques , and other civilian locations , as it had previously in other parts of Gaza . If the war pause ends in the next 4 - 10 days , the IDF would be expected to spend some days or up to a week finishing with Hamas in Jabalia and Zeitoun as well as taking on Hamas in the tough Shejaiya neighborhood where some of the harshest battles were fought in 2014 . The IDF would also need to eventually invade Khan Younis and Rafah , among other Hamas southern strongholds , which could take more time to subdue .
