That old joke was wrong . The book of Jewish sporting achievements is in fact quite thick ... and fascinating .& ldquo ; In many ways , the development of Jewish sports reflects the realities of Jewish life over the past 120 years ,& rdquo ; says Osnat Zur , director of the Iris Smith World Jewish Sports Museum in Ramat Gan & rsquo ; s Kfar Hamaccabiah campus . The innovative 21st - century museum , inaugurated during the 22nd Maccabiah in 2022 , depicts an under - recounted aspect of the development of Jewish identity and Zionism .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; The museum in essence tells not only the story of Jewish sports but of the Jews in general in the 20th century ,& rdquo ; says Zur . & ldquo ; We embark on a journey through time , see how the nationalist movements arose around the world , how the first Maccabiah offered a vision , through the disaster of the Holocaust & ndash ; from which it took decades for Jewish sports to recover & ndash ; the Munich massacre , and on to October 7 .& rdquo ; A visit to the interactive display , suitable for children and adults alike , puts Jewish sporting achievements in perspective . The 1 , 500 square - meter museum , designed by Israeli company Breeze Creative , presents the history and heritage of Jewish sports through more than 1 , 000 rare items , videos , and exhibits .& nbsp ; The museum & rsquo ; s timeline begins in 1890 with the establishment of the first Jewish sports club in Constantinople , Turkey , built around a fencing team . Then Max Nordau & rsquo ; s famous & ldquo ; muscular Jew & rdquo ; speech at the second Zionist Conference in Basel , Switzerland , in 1898 sparked the birth of dozens of Jewish sports clubs throughout Europe , and Jewish sports flourished in the early part of the 20th century .& nbsp ; In terms of achievements , the best was Hakoah Vienna , champions of the Austrian national soccer league in 1924 - 25 and runners - up in 1921 - 22 . The soccer club & rsquo ; s parent association was the largest sporting organization in the world in its time , numbering more than 5 , 000 members and offering a wide variety of sporting activities .& nbsp ; Jewish sports & ndash ; notably fencing and boxing & ndash ; prospered in Europe until Nazism reared its evil head . The museum & rsquo ; s displays chart the rise in antisemitism in Europe , with Jewish athletes and teams gradually banned from competing . The chronological section devoted to 1933 - 39 is titled & ldquo ; From Champions to Victims .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Hitler viewed the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games as a propaganda tool & ndash ; and the world agreed to his terms , as one of the video displays explains ( in your chosen language ). Signs at entrances to the Olympic stadium pronounced & ldquo ; No entry for dogs and Jews .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Then - world champion swimmer Judith Deutch refused to represent Austria , made aliyah instead , and passed away in 2004 after a meaningful life in Israel . It should be noted , however , that other Jews competed in the Olympic Games , and were forced to salute Hitler .& nbsp ; Hakoah Vienna could not survive the Anschluss of March 11 - 13 , 1938 , when Nazi Germany annexed neighboring Austria , and the club disbanded in 1941 , only to reestablish itself after World War II on a modest scale . Meanwhile , as more Jewish immigrants poured into pre - state Israel , the local sporting unions Maccabi , Hapoel , and Beitar burgeoned , each with its own political affiliations and patrons .& nbsp ; The Maccabiah is really one man & rsquo ; s idea . Yosef Yekutieli & ndash ; who later went on to establish the Israel Football Association and Israel Olympic Committee & ndash ; had the then - maverick vision of holding a & ldquo ; Jewish Olympics & rdquo ; in 1932 , and advertised the event by riding his motorcycle throughout Europe . Some 470 competitors turned up for the inaugural Games in Tel Aviv that year . For the second Maccabiah in 1935 , some 1 , 200 athletes competed in a specially erected stadium and swimming pool . Then came the war . The third Maccabiah in 1952 was a small , sad event that became known as the & ldquo ; revival Maccabiah & rdquo ; & ndash ; an axiom to be repeated in the 2025 event . Since then , the quadrennial Games have increasingly attracted Jewish ( and some non - Jewish ) athletes by the thousands , earning the moniker & ldquo ; the second - largest sporting event in the world & rdquo ; ( in terms of number of athletes competing ) after the Olympics . The Maccabiah is an event with a meaning beyond sports . Among the dignitaries attending the last opening ceremony was US President Joe Biden . Documenting the pastThe need for a museum documenting the rise , fall , and rise again of Jewish sports has become more evident as more Jewish athletes have made their mark on the world stage .& nbsp ; Admittedly , Jews may not have left their mark the way they have , say , on the Nobel Prize , but the list of Jewish sports legends & ndash ; from the 18th - century father of scientific boxing Daniel Mendoza , through baseball legend Sandy Koufax to multiple gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz & ndash ; is richer than generally perceived .& ldquo ; There had been more talk about establishing the museum over the past decade ,& rdquo ; says Zur . & ldquo ; Then came a generous donation from Iris Smith that allowed the project to go ahead .& rdquo ; Orit Engelberg - Baram was chosen as content curator , a committee of leading sportspeople and sports historians assembled ... then the pandemic broke out , and everything stopped . & ldquo ; Ultimately , this actually worked for our good ,& rdquo ; says Zur . & ldquo ; Maccabi & rsquo ; s outside activities came to a halt , suddenly freeing up time and resources for this project in a new building under construction on the site of the old museum .& rdquo ;( The site at Kfar Maccabiah was previously home to a charming , if somewhat aging , corner called The Pierre Gildesgame Maccabi Sports Museum , established in 1982 , with an archive and exhibits concerning Judaism , Zionism , and Sports .)& nbsp ; The museum employs English -, Spanish -, and Hebrew - speaking guides . Over 40 , 000 visitors have passed through so far , mainly Israeli school and pensioner groups and Jewish groups such as Taglit - Birthright and Masa , but also & ndash ; somewhat surprisingly & ndash ; many individual non - Jewish tourists . & ldquo ; They want to understand the essence of this country , and sports is part of that ,& rdquo ; explains Zur , a former Young Maccabi emissary in the US who is now director of the Maccabiah ' s Education Department & nbsp ;& ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not easy to be a Jewish sportsperson nowadays ,& rdquo ; she notes . & ldquo ; Jewish athletes worldwide are increasingly afraid to identify with Israel .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Even more so their non - Jewish colleagues , at a time when being pro - Palestinian is considered cool .& nbsp ; Within days of October 7 , the Maccabi World Union launched its Sportspeakup project , recruiting over 150 leading athletes from around the world & ndash ; including 15 non - Jewish former NBA basketball players & ndash ; who recorded social media messages calling for the release of Israeli hostages .& nbsp ; But it wasn & rsquo ; t easy .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; Even though it & rsquo ; s a humanitarian issue not a political one , many of the sportspeople we approached said they were scared to participate . They didn & rsquo ; t want to deal with antisemitic cries from supporters at their games ,& rdquo ; explains Zur .& nbsp ; Victory of sports over evilAs Israeli society slowly recovers from the trauma , the museum & rsquo ; s first planned temporary exhibition in July will concentrate on October 7 and sports . & ldquo ; Many sportspeople died that day ,& rdquo ; Zur sighs . & ldquo ; There were some heart - wrenching stories , a mixed reaction from the sports world to the event , and more antisemitism in sports .& rdquo ; The exhibition will recount the story of Israeli sports through the mirror of October 7 , focusing on the sporting victories in this most difficult year in the country & rsquo ; s history . Visitors will pass through three tracks that combine the sounds of war and the roar of victory , between the battlefield and the sports field . The first track describes the reality for Israel & rsquo ; s sporting representatives since October 7 , the humiliation and ostracism they face alongside the support and encouragement , and their victories on the sports field . Central to this part of the exhibition will be the historic gold medal of Israeli gymnast Artyom Dolgopiat , won at the World Championships on October 7 at 14 : 00 Israel time . The second track will memorialize the athletes murdered or wounded on October 7 and the ensuing war , while the third track will tell the story of the missing fans who will never wear their team colors again .& nbsp ; The three tracks will converge to celebrate the victory of sports over evil & ndash ; the Olympic Games in Paris in July 2024 is due to include the largest Israeli delegation ever , and the 2025 Maccabiah looks like it will be the biggest in history . This exhibition will convey two main messages . To world Jewry : & ldquo ; You are not alone .& rdquo ; And to the world sporting community , & ldquo ; More Than Ever ,& rdquo ; with record numbers of participants at the next Olympic Games and Maccabiah . â–  Staying on the mapFor decades , participation on the world stage was every Israeli athlete & rsquo ; s dream . Nobody talked about winning & ndash ; until Maccabi Tel Aviv & rsquo ; s groundbreaking first basketball European Champions Cup in 1977 . That game is best remembered for captain Tal Brody & rsquo ; s prophetic after - game exclamation : & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re on the map and we & rsquo ; re staying on the map & ndash ; not only in sport , but in everything !& rdquo ; a sound bite that has become a part of Israeli culture .& nbsp ;& ldquo ; Israeli sports in general is continuing to improve , even through this tough period ,& rdquo ; says Brody , now a sprightly 80 . & ldquo ; In the past few months , we & rsquo ; ve seen international achievements in judo , gymnastics , swimming , wind surfing , taekwondo , and even kick boxing .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; It & rsquo ; s time to stand up and be counted , even in sports that don & rsquo ; t make the big headlines , explains Brody , who made aliyah from Trenton , New Jersey , in 1966 , forfeiting a budding NBA career . Still far from being a sporting powerhouse , Israel is beginning to make its mark on the world stage . Brody puts this down to a cultural shift . & ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s far more physical activity here than in the past . The authorities understand far better the importance of sporting facilities , and now our cities have bicycle lanes , and the parks are full of joggers .& ldquo ; Israelis are waking up in a sad mood nowadays . Many have lost loved ones or have soldiers on the front line . With all the sorrow , as the day goes on sports gives them spirit and pride . Our athletes have to go out to the world where people don & rsquo ; t understand the situation , where they hear false narratives and there & rsquo ; s an antisemitic atmosphere . But the people of Israel believe in the country , and our sportsmen also feel this . Even as the war rages , our athletes are taking top places in competitions in places like Qatar and Tashkent , proudly competing with the Star of David on their uniforms .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
