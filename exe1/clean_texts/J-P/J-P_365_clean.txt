& nbsp ; Delegates to the 16th Socialist International were milling about the Montechoro Hotel & rsquo ; s lobby in Albufeira , a sleepy resort town off of Portugal & rsquo ; s Algarve coast , when a gunman nailed five bullets into Palestinian cardiologist Isam Sartawi & rsquo ; s chest and head .
& nbsp ;
The assassin vanished under a hail of police bullets . His target , the first PLO leader to advocate recognition of Israel , and also to openly hold talks with Israelis , was soon pronounced dead , along with his message .
& nbsp ;
Sartawi & rsquo ; s Israeli interlocutors came from the thick Left , people like Maj .- Gen . ( res .) Matti Peled and former Labor Party secretary - general Arieh Eliav , but when shot he was but one wall away from Shimon Peres , who would become prime minister the following year .
& nbsp ;
Rumors of a planned meeting between the two were probably unfounded , but to the assailants & ndash ; the Abu - Nidal terrorist group & ndash ; that didn & rsquo ; t matter ; Sartawi spoke peace , and that made him anathema and his death foretold .
& nbsp ;
It was part of a pattern , one that neither began nor ended on that sorry day in April 1983 , and in fact laces Israel & rsquo ; s history almost from its birth to these very days of awe ; days which make many assume fatalistically that peace - killers will always defeat the peacemakers . Well they haven & rsquo ; t , and they won & rsquo ; t .
& nbsp ;
THE FIRST of the peacemakers to fall in the line of duty was Jordan & rsquo ; s King Abdullah , who was shot in 1951 at the Mosque of Omar & rsquo ; s entrance after holding secret talks with David Ben - Gurion & rsquo ; s emissaries .
& nbsp ;
Two years before Sartawi & rsquo ; s murder , Anwar Sadat was mowed down by four Islamist gunmen who emerged from a truck during a military parade and emptied their Kalashnikovs at the presidential podium killing , besides Sadat , another 10 men . The young peace treaty with Israel , though only part of a broader Islamist agenda , was a key element in the squad & rsquo ; s motivation .
& nbsp ;
The following year Lebanese president - elect Bashir Gemayel , who had been dialoguing with Israel for a while and was widely expected to make peace with Menachem Begin , was blown up along with 26 others during a political meeting in Beirut . The assassin , widely believed to have been activated by Syrian agents , cited the alliance with Israel as the cause of his act .
& nbsp ;
The common denominator among all these assaults is the belief that Arab - Jewish peace , no matter how limited or embryonic , is an abomination that must be nipped in the bud .
& nbsp ;
Now this history is once again at play ; not in Hamas & rsquo ; s quest to fight & ndash ; that & rsquo ; s a given that needs no pretext & ndash ; but in its timing . Hamas could have started this round of violence long before or well after this month . What made it press the trigger was Israel & rsquo ; s first - ever Arab - Jewish coalition agreement , which was but several days away from being signed .
& nbsp ;
The extraordinary Bennett - Abbas - Lapid government was set to inspire a great Arab - Jewish reconciliation , a prospect that from the viewpoint of Hamas was intolerable . Like Sartawi & rsquo ; s evolving dialogue and like Gemayel & rsquo ; s burgeoning peace & ndash ; it had to be preempted . Hence the rush , scope , and total abandonment of measure with which Hamas unleashed its wrath .
& nbsp ;
Time will tell to what extent the fighting & rsquo ; s spillover to Israel & rsquo ; s mixed towns was micromanaged by Hamas operatives . However , it is clear already now that the rampages in Lod , Acre and Jaffa served Hamas well , and that whether or not they were conducted from Gaza they were clearly incited from there .
& nbsp ;
Worse , in terms of its immediate aim the ploy worked . The breathtaking move Naftali Bennett had already introduced with the inspiring statement that & ldquo ; a broad government is not a default , it & rsquo ; s an aim ,& rdquo ; was summarily shelved .
& nbsp ;
Like that peace with Lebanon & rsquo ; s elected president which Israel was already touching and smelling only to see him and his gospel murdered , the great reconciliation that Bennett and Mansour Abbas seemed ready to launch was trampled , overnight , by thugs who lynched pedestrians , shattered storefronts , and torched synagogues .
& nbsp ;
The question this plunge from utopia to dystopia raises is therefore this : Can peace survive its murder ?
& nbsp ;
STRATEGIC SURPRISES are good at what they announce & ndash ; surprise & ndash ; but their planners often fail to plan for what their surprises uncork .
& nbsp ;
Hitler & rsquo ; s invasion of the Soviet Union , Japan & rsquo ; s attack on Pearl Harbor and Egypt & rsquo ; s crossing of the Suez Canal were stunning . All three , however , were ultimately defeated . Hamas & rsquo ; s strategic surprise is headed the same way .
& nbsp ;
The Germans disparaged the Russians & rsquo ; industrial ability , the Japanese underestimated America & rsquo ; s fighting spirit , the Egyptians didn & rsquo ; t calculate Israeli improvisation , and Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t understand what the sight of a torched synagogue does to a Jew , any Jew , even a leftist , an agnostic or a convert .
& nbsp ;
On this front the counterattack is already underway , with hundreds of arrests that will be followed by harsh indictments that will produce lengthy jail terms .
& nbsp ;
Equally swift will be the physical restoration that the peace - murderers & rsquo ; carnage demands . It will take months , but every ruined synagogue , hotel , restaurant and shop will be repaired , as will all the vandalized parks , playgrounds , plazas and bus stops , not to mention ransacked police stations .
& nbsp ;
Much more difficult will be the rehabilitation of the surprise attack & rsquo ; s big target : communal relations that were built over generations .
& nbsp ;
Yes , the struggle ahead of us is daunting , the civic version of defending Stalingrad and wresting Iwo Jima , but like those battles , it will end in evil & rsquo ; s defeat .
& nbsp ;
Anwar Sadat was murdered , but the peace he struck survived him , and lives to this day .
& nbsp ;
Mansour Abbas & rsquo ; s emergence in an Israeli coalition has apparently been derailed , but he still showed up at the burnt Beit Yisrael Synagogue and , with Lod Mayor Yair Revivo ( Likud ) alongside him , denounced the arson as anti - Islamic and vowed to participate in its reconstruction .
& nbsp ;
Yes , the Arab - Jewish coalition which Middle Israelis crave , the situation begs , and nearly half the Arab electorate endorsed & ndash ; is dead . Its spirit , however , lives on .
