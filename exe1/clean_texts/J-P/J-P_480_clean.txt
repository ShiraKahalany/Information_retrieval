Hamas on Saturday warned Palestinians not to talk about the sites that Israel targeted during the 11 - days of fighting .

The warning , issued by the Hamas Internal Security Agency ( ISA ), called on Palestinians to & ldquo ; raise the level of security awareness .& rdquo ;

The ISA warned Palestinians against & ldquo ; the transmission of information and holding unnecessary conversations related to what happened during the [ Israeli ] aggression , especially about the places and sites that were targeted .& rdquo ;

The ISA claimed that Israel has stepped up its intelligence activities & ldquo ; to gather information about the resistance and its movements as part of an effort to update its bank of targets .& rdquo ;

The Hamas security agency also warned Palestinians against making statements to & ldquo ; suspicious parties impersonating relief or charitable institutions .& rdquo ;

Palestinian sources in the Gaza Strip said the warning was given in an attempt to hide the damage caused to its tunnels and weapons arsenals during the Israeli air strikes . The sources pointed out that the headquarters of the ISA were completely destroyed by Israel during the fighting .

Other sources predicted that Hamas would soon arrest scores of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on suspicion of & ldquo ; collaboration & rdquo ; with Israel during the fighting .

Eyad al - Bozom , spokesman of the Hamas - run Interior Ministry , threatened that his group & ldquo ; will continue to strike with an iron fist against the agents of the occupation & rsquo ; s security and intelligence services .& rdquo ;

Bozom said that the Hamas security forces began redeploying after the ceasefire announcement on Friday morning . & ldquo ; We assure our people of the stability of the security situation and the strength of the home front , and we will not abandon our duty , regardless of the sacrifices , and we will remain loyal to the blood of the martyrs ,& rdquo ; he added .
