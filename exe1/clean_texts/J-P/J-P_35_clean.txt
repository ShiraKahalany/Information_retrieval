Former prime minister Naftali Bennett sparked speculation that he plans to return to politics , when he took to X to mark three years since he was sworn in as Israel & rsquo ; s 13th premier , noting that Israel needed a government that would put the interests of the people before anything else . היום לפני שלוש שנים נשבעתי אמונים כראש הממשלה ה - 13 של מדינת ישראל . במשך קצת יותר משנה שירתתי אתכם אזרחי ישראל כשעמדתי בראשה של ממשלה שעד לאותו רגע הייתה נראית בלתי אפשרית . אחרי ארבעה סבבי בחירות , מגיפת קורונה , משבר כלכלי , מאות אלפי מובטלים ומדינה שנמצאת בשיתוק - שרים משמאל & hellip ; pic . twitter . com / iJeETjciwN & mdash ; Naftali Bennett נפתלי בנט (@ naftalibennett ) June 13 , 2024 & ldquo ; Friends , we did it then & ndash ; we can do it again ,& rdquo ; he said , talking about how anxious and desperate many Israelis felt and reminding them that & ldquo ; even when everything seems impossible , it is possible .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; We will yet bring about a state here that is worthy of this nation ,& rdquo ; he announced . Bennett commented on the situation that Israel was in before his unity government was formed , noting that it was after four rounds of elections and the pandemic . & ldquo ; Ministers from the Left and Right decided to put their differences aside and come together to save the State of Israel ,& rdquo ; he said .& ldquo ; We took care of all citizens in Israel and did not put one sector in front of the other ,& rdquo ; he added . Israel & rsquo ; s current reality & ldquo ; demands leadership that knows how to unify the people and do the most basic thing that a government should do : put the interest of the State of Israel before any other consideration , work wisely with the international community , bring all parts of the people into the circle of service , and manage the war with clear goals until our enemies are defeated ,& rdquo ; Bennett said . Politicians react to BennetOpposition head Yair Lapid , who led the unity government alongside Bennett , echoed him on Twitter .& ldquo ; We will yet bring about a state here that is worthy of this nation ,& rdquo ; Lapid said in a post on X , which shared Bennett & rsquo ; s original post . Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Minister Amichai Chikli ( Likud ), who entered the Knesset as part of Bennett & rsquo ; s Yamina Party but left the party soon after the elections , also responded to the post . Today is the third anniversary of Bennett & ldquo ; breaking his promise to hundreds of thousands of voters [ that he ] would not form a government with those who support [ law ] suits against IDF officers in The Hague ,& rdquo ; said Chikli , adding that he believed Bennett also broke his promise that he would & ldquo ; not be part of a boycott of the biggest right - wing party ,& rdquo ; and & ldquo ; would not form a government with a dangerous Islamist party .& rdquo ; Chikli added that while currently in Israel there is , & ldquo ; without a doubt , a lot to fix and improve ,& rdquo ; he did not think that things would have been better under Bennett & rsquo ; s unity government . This war is complex and being waged under intense international pressure , he said , & ldquo ; but let & rsquo ; s be honest , if Lapid were the prime minister right now , we both know that it & rsquo ; s doubtful that there would be an intense ground operation in Gaza . There certainly would not be an operation in Rafah , and you would probably be walking into the sunset of a surrender deal with [ US Secretary of State Antony ] Blinken .& rdquo ;
