Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) prisoners have suspended their hunger strike after reaching an agreement with Israeli authorities , PIJ officials said on Friday .
& ldquo ; The prisoners decided to suspend the hunger strike after they scored victory against the administration of the occupation prison authorities ,& rdquo ; said PIJ official Tareq Ezaddin .
The details of the agreement between the prisoners and the Israel Prison Service will be announced in the coming hours , Ezaddin said . & ldquo ; The victory is a turning point in the confrontation with the [ Israeli ] jailer ,& rdquo ; he added .
A statement issued by the leadership of the PIJ prisoners held in Israeli prisons confirmed that the hunger strike , which began nine days ago , has ended .

Sheikh Khader Adnan , a senior PIJ official in the northern West Bank , & ldquo ; congratulated & rdquo ; the families of the prisoners of PIJ for ending the hunger strike . He did not provide details about the alleged agreement with the Israeli authorities .
Some 250 PIJ inmates went on hunger strike nine days ago in protest of restrictions imposed on them following the escape of six prisoners from Gilboa Prison last month .& nbsp ;
Five of the escapees belong to PIJ , while the sixth , Zakariya Zbeidi , is a member of the ruling Fatah faction headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
On Thursday , the PIJ threatened to expand the hunger strike to include all 400 PIJ prisoners if the demands of the inmates are not met .
The prisoners demanded that the Israel Prison Service rescind its decision to transfer them to other prisons and place some of them in solitary confinement following the prison break .
