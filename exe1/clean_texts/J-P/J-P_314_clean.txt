Internationally acclaimed and Grammy Award - winning violinist Gil Shaham will join the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Karen Kamensek , herself a Grammy Award - winning artist , for a performance of Anton & iacute ; n Dvor & aacute ; k & rsquo ; s Violin Concerto in a series of shows from June 16 - 23 . The 53 - year - old Shaham grew up in Israel and left at a young age for an international career as one of the world & rsquo ; s leading soloists . On stage , with his gaunt almost haggard features and eyes fixed on the violin , he seems like a Mephistophelean figure , conjoined with the violin as it abides and subjugates itself to his technique .& nbsp ; Just before arriving in Israel for the first time since the Gaza war began , the New York - based Shaham told The Jerusalem Post that he was eager to visit the country .& ldquo ; Look , these are tragic times . It & rsquo ; s just an ocean of suffering and tragedy , an ocean of pain . And I do feel that music has a way to bring solace to people . I think music is very life - affirming and brings people together ,& rdquo ; he said , appearing uneasy discussing the political situation .& ldquo ; You know , there was one time when we performed with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli Philharmonic at the BBC Proms , and as we were playing , there were loud protests coming from outside , and even louder counter - protests . I looked at Zubin , and he sort of looked at me and said , & lsquo ; Just keep playing , just keep making music .& rsquo ; I thought that was a good statement on many levels .& rdquo ; According to Shaham , Dvor & aacute ; k & rsquo ; s Violin Concerto is one of his masterpieces .& ldquo ; I was thinking a little bit about Beethoven and the great works of the past . Many of them were written during brutal , terrible times . The Dvor & aacute ; k Violin Concerto has a very Beethovenian narrative . When you take a piece that starts in the minor mode but at the end arrives in the major , it really offers hope , you know . And it & rsquo ; s so uplifting in that way . And I think that & rsquo ; s also true for the piece we will be playing ,& rdquo ; he said . A perfect fitHaving performed with the IPO since the 1980s under Mehta , Shaham has had a perfect seat to see its developments over the years .& ldquo ; I think they are playing better than ever before . There are so many star musicians there ,& rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s interesting for me because nowadays , I feel I & rsquo ; m probably one of the older people on stage . There are some brilliant young musicians , and I feel lucky that they still include me and still want to play with me .& rdquo ; He added that he had performed with the IPO & rsquo ; s Lahav Shani several times .& ldquo ; We & rsquo ; ve had several opportunities to play a handful of different concertos . I also got to play with him in his pianist role . I & rsquo ; m a big fan of his and the orchestra ,& rdquo ; said Shaham . Shaham and the IPO will also be performing Bedrich Smetana Vlatava ( Moldau ), Dvor & aacute ; k & rsquo ; s Slavonic dances , and Richard Strauss & rsquo ; s Four Symphonic Interludes from his 1924 comic Opera Intermezzo .
