Comet , who recently celebrated his 100th birthday , held leading positions in Jewish community organizations , including senior director in the World Zionist Organization , the Council of Jewish Federations , and other Jewish organizations for more than 75 years . In 1965 , he founded the Salute to Israel Parade in New York . In the 1960s , he helped organize some of the first large demonstrations in support of Soviet Jewry . Comet continues his Zionist activities with daily meetings and a full schedule . Yaakov Hagoel , Chairman of the World Zionist Organization : & ldquo ; Precisely in these days when antisemitism is on the rise , Ted Comet & rsquo ; s initiative to march in New York with pride for Israel is a tremendous contribution to national morale , and for that , I am grateful . & nbsp ; The parade is the most significant Jewish - Zionist event that takes place in the United States in support and solidarity with the State of Israel . Despite the threat of antisemitism , we raise our heads and call for the immediate release of the hostages , for the complete victory of the IDF soldiers over the enemy , for the fight against antisemitism , with uncompromising support for the principles of justice , freedom , and mutual responsibility .& rdquo ;
