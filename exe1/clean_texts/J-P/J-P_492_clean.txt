A new opinion poll , carried out by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies , was published on January 10 . The poll , which collected data from 8 , 000 Arab respondents from 16 countries , aimed to determine how Arab populations perceived the Israel - Hamas war . Amongst one of the many findings of the survey , it was noted that 67 % of respondents perceived Hamas & rsquo ; s October 7 attack , categorized by the survey as & ldquo ; the military operation carried out by Hamas ,& rdquo ; as & ldquo ; a legitimate resistance operation .& rdquo ; The survey results clarified that 19 % answered that the attack was legitimate but & ldquo ; flawed ,& rdquo ; 3 % said it was legitimate but & ldquo ; involved heinous or criminal acts & rdquo ; and only 5 % called the attack & ldquo ; illegitimate .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Why did Hamas attack , according to respondents ? While many have seen Hamas & rsquo ; s attack on Israel as a proxy war for Iran , only 2 % of respondents agreed , while 35 % of Arab respondents stated their belief that the number one reason behind the attack was & ldquo ; The ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian land .& rdquo ; The second most given reason was & ldquo ; Defending al - Aqsa Mosque against attacks ,& rdquo ; which 24 % of respondents affirmed as their believed reason .& nbsp ; The al - Aqsa Mosque has been a source of tension as it is located above the Temple Mount , a holy site for both Jews and Christians . While non - Muslims now have permission to attend their holy site via the Moors Gate , they are forbidden from praying there which has created increased tension . Jewish activists have repeatedly tried to pray at the site , which has been met with escalating conflict .& nbsp ; While 24 % argued that defending the mosque was the most important reason behind the attack , a Hamas rocket would have landed on the holy site in December , if Israel & rsquo ; s Iron Dome system hadn & rsquo ; t prevented the attack .& nbsp ; Only 8 % of the respondents felt the & ldquo ;[ t ] he ongoing blockade of Gaza & rdquo ; was the main reason for the attack , with a further 12 % claiming it to be the second most important reason .& nbsp ; Israel withdrew citizens from Gaza in 2005 , creating a separate territory that was taken over by Hamas in 2006 . Gaza borders both Israel and Egypt , with crossings policed heavily by both countries . Palestinians , before October 7 , had been permitted to enter Israel with proper documentation for work , medical treatments or for other reasons .& nbsp ; Arab solidarity with Palestinians and HamasIn mass agreement , 92 % of respondents expressed they had a feeling of solidarity with Gaza & rsquo ; s Palestinian population . In addition , 69 % said they supported both the Palestinians and Hamas . Only 1 % said they had no feelings of solidarity with the Palestinians and 23 % said they had feelings of solidarity for Palestinians but opposed Hamas . Opinions on international partiesWhen asked about the responses of regional and international powers to the war , 94 % said they considered the United States position negatively , with 82 % clarifying they thought it was bad . The same trend continued for other Western countries with 79 %, 78 %, and 75 % of respondents viewed the positions of France , the UK , and Germany negatively . In a different survey response , 81 % said that they did not believe the US was serious about establishing a Palestinian state and 77 % of respondents named the US and Israel as the biggest threat to the security and stability of the region . US Secretary of State Andrew Blinken continued to advocate for a Palestinian state only yesterday , claiming that it was the best way to marginalize Iran .& nbsp ; Additionally , while one May survey found that over half of Palestinians wanted a two - state solution , a November survey by the Arab World for Research and Development found that over 70 % of Palestinians support only a singular Palestinian state without a Jewish one . Arab opinion on Iran , Turkey , Russia , and China was more split , with 48 %, 47 %, 41 %, and 40 % perceiving the countries positively . Normalizing ties with IsraelWhen asked what steps Arab governments should take in response to the war , 36 % of respondents stated that Arab governments should suspend all relations or normalization processes with Israel , and a further 14 % said aid should be sent to Gaza without Israeli approval . A further 29 % of respondents suggested that Arab countries should either & ldquo ; provide military aid to Gaza & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; announce military mobilization & rdquo ; against Israel .
