Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir - Abdollahian joked a day after Israel & rsquo ; s strikes in Iran that the weapons used were & ldquo ; more like toys that our children play with & ndash ; not drones ,& rdquo ; according to a Saturday article from Iran & rsquo ; s semi - official Mehr News Agency .& nbsp ; Making the comments in an interview with NBC News , Abdollahian said " As long as there is no new adventurism by Israel against our interests , then we are not going to have any new reactions .& rdquo ; Threats against Israel " If Israel takes a decisive action against my country and this is proven to us ," he said , " our response will be immediate and to the maximum and will cause them to regret it ." The foreign minister went on to threaten that his comments were only a warning , and that & ldquo ; We could have hit Haifa and Tel Aviv & hellip ; We could have also targeted all the economic ports of Israel .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Abdollahian said that the only reason that Iran had not successfully hit Haifa , Tel Aviv or any major port was because Iran & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; red lines [ were ] civilians & hellip ; We only had a military purpose .& rdquo ; A 7 - year - old Arab girl was killed during Iran & rsquo ; s mass drone attack which saw hundreds of UAVs and multiple ballistic missiles fired seemingly randomly at Israel . While few Iranian aerial assault weapons successfully hit Israel , one hit a northern Arab village and one hit Arad - which is where the 7 - year - old girl was killed .& nbsp ;
