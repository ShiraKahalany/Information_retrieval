& nbsp ; Palestinian armed groups have called for mass protests as the High Court is scheduled on Monday to issue a ruling on an appeal against the eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah .
& nbsp ;
Lower courts had ruled that several homes in Sheikh Jarrah , known in Hebrew as Shimon HaTzadik , were owned by Jews before 1948 . The planned evictions of the triggered widespread protests in the neighborhood and other parts of Jerusalem over the past few months .
& nbsp ;
Last week , The Jerusalem Post revealed that Prime Minister Naftali Bennet does not plan to evict the families even of the High Court makes it possible . Sources close to Bennet said that they did not expect the court to order the government to enforce any eviction order or to impose a deadline .
& nbsp ;
A statement issued by several Palestinian armed groups on Sunday called on the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem to & ldquo ; ignite the flame of resistance under the feet of the Zionist occupiers .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The occupation & rsquo ; s aggression against our people in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah is increasing ,& rdquo ; the statement read . & ldquo ; In addition , the aggression against the families threatened with displacement continues . The crimes of the occupation have not stopped .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Voicing & ldquo ; full solidarity & rdquo ; with the Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank , the terror groups said that they will defend them as they did during the & ldquo ; Sword of Jerusalem & rdquo ; battle , the name Hamas uses to describe its 11 - day war with Israel last May .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The resistance groups that defended the people of Jerusalem and the West Bank will not fail them ,& rdquo ; the groups added . & ldquo ; We call on our people in the West Bank and Jerusalem to continue to ignite the flame of resistance at all points of contact with the Zionist occupier , and to ignite the occupied land under the feet of the Zionist usurpers .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Mohammed Hamadeh , a spokesperson for Hamas , warned Israel against & ldquo ; playing with fire & rdquo ; regarding the possible eviction of the Sheikh Jarrah families .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Palestinian people , who refuse to give up and surrender , will continue to resist all attempts by the occupier [ to evict the families ],& rdquo ; Hamadeh said . & ldquo ; We are ready to respond to the aggression of the occupation . What the resistance groups did not allow in the past , they will not allow today or tomorrow . The occupation must learn the lesson and stop tampering with the Jerusalem neighborhoods .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Hamas official accused Israel of planning to & ldquo ; Judaize & rdquo ; Jerusalem and expel the Palestinians from the city .
& nbsp ;
Fatah activists in east Jerusalem also called for protests on Monday in solidarity with the Sheikh Jarrah families .
& nbsp ;
On the eve of the court ruling , Palestinian Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs , Fadi al - Hidmi , warned that any decision to evict the Palestinian families & ldquo ; would bring matters back to square one .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The case of the Sheikh Jarrah families has reached & ldquo ; a critical and dangerous situation that requires urgent intervention by the international community , to prevent matters from returning to square one ,& rdquo ; Hidmi cautioned .
& nbsp ;
He accused the Israeli government of presenting the case as a dispute over real estate and claimed that what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah is & ldquo ; a political issue par excellence .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The Israeli government & rsquo ; s attempts to show that this is a legal dispute over real estate & ldquo ; will not deceive anyone ,& rdquo ; Hidmi said . & ldquo ; The whole world knows that the issue is political , and that what is happening is an attempt to replace the original owners of the land with settlers .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The PA official said that the Palestinians do not trust the Israeli courts which , he claimed , & ldquo ; serve as an executive tool & rdquo ; that works for the benefit of the Israeli government and settlers .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The international community , especially the US , the European Union and the United Nations , must be firm in rejecting the displacement plans ,& rdquo ; Hidmi continued . & ldquo ; We do not rely on the Israeli courts , and we believe that only firm and decisive international intervention can force the Israeli government to reverse its decisions . Any decision to evict families from their homes will bring matters back to square one and undermine all international efforts that have been made in the past months .& rdquo ;
