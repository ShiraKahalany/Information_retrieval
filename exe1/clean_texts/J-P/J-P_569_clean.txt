Syria as a site for Iranian proxy attacksIran has frequently used Syria as a base to launch proxy attacks on Israel , & nbsp ; The Jerusalem Post & nbsp ; previously reported . As per Seth Frantzman ' s analysis , many experts percieve Syria to be one of the many fronts that Iran has been using to expand its proxy attacks against Israel - even basing some IRGC officers there until recently . While Iran made moves last month to remove IRGC officers , after a strike killed IRGC commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi , Iran ' s proxy groups have continued to launch attacks . Only yesterday , Houthi terrorists launched ballistic missiles at ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea as part of its ' Axis of Resistance .'
