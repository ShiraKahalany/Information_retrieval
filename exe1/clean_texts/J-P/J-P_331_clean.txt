The decision by the Defense Ministry to designate six Palestinian NGOs as arms of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization quickly developed into an international storm , with the US , the UN and the EU raising objections and questioning the validity of the move .& nbsp ;
On Monday , European Union Representative to the Palestinians Sven K & uuml ; hn Von Burgsdorff visited the six Palestinian NGOs Defense Minister Benny Gantz had targeted . On Wednesday , representatives of 25 Israeli nongovernmental groups paid a solidarity visit to the Al - Haq office in Ramallah to voice their opposition to the designation .
Two divergent narratives emerged in the wake of the decision . In one reality resides Gantz , the Defense Ministry and pro - Israel NGOs , subscribed to the reality that long - ignored terrorist activity cynically cloaked in the guise of human rights has finally been unmasked .
The other narrative considers the six NGOs to be human rights organizations and considers the designation to be a draconian attack on Palestinian civil society .& nbsp ;
On one side , you have Prof . Gerald M . Steinberg , president and founder of NGO Monitor , who says : & ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s no justification for not considering or ignoring or overlooking the terrorist connections . These are not trivial . People & ndash ; Israelis & ndash ; have been killed .& rdquo ;

On the other side , there & rsquo ; s Samer Sinijlawi , chairman of the Jerusalem Development Fund and Fatah activist from Jerusalem , who says : & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s just a blind war against all voices that are criticizing the occupation and the abuse of the human rights of the Palestinians .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
Which reality is true ? Is Israel trying to suppress Palestinian civil society , or is it a legitimate grievance against terrorist organizations ? After reviewing the importance of the NGOs and their terrorism connections , where one falls seems to be a matter of priorities .
PFLP affiliation
The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Marxist military group recognized as a terrorist group by most of the Western world .& nbsp ;
Israel claims that Addameer , Al - Haq , Bisan Center , Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine ( DCI - P ), Union of Agricultural Work Committees ( UAWC ) and the Union of Palestinian Women & rsquo ; s Committees ( UPWC ) are part of a PFLP terrorist network that recruits , provides legitimacy to operatives , and serves as a leadership wing for the PFLP . They & rsquo ; ve been accused of funneling funding to terrorism through forgery , laundering , and the awarding of stipends to the families of terrorists .& nbsp ;
The government hasn & rsquo ; t provided much information to prove its allegations . But little has been done to dispute them other than to note the groups & rsquo ; statuses as human rights NGOs . This leaves everyone else to make sense of the diverging realities . The NGOs have rejected the claims , but groups like NGO Monitor assert that there is enough open source documentation to prove that the only thing under attack is terrorism .
Al - Haq
Established in 1979 and based in Ramallah , Al - Haq is an award - winning NGO with connections with dozens of international human right bodes , which describes itself as a human rights NGO that & ldquo ; documents violations of the individual and collective rights of Palestinians .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
Al - Haq was the first NGO that drew Steinberg & rsquo ; s suspicion of PFLP connections , & ldquo ; and in many ways is the most significant , of the ones that were recently designated as terrorist organizations ,& rdquo ; he said .
& ldquo ; Al - Haq is headed by Shawan Jabarin , who sat in Israeli jail for a while , was convicted of being an activist member of the PFLP ,& rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; The court ruled that he is a human rights worker by day and a terrorist official by night .& rdquo ;
According to NGO Monitor , in 2018 , Visa , Mastercard , and American Express shut down online donations to Al - Haq due to PFLP ties .
Al - Haq asserted in a statement that the & ldquo ; baseless allegations & rdquo ; seek & ldquo ; to delegitimize , oppress , silence & rdquo ; Palestinian NGOs . It argued that the decision is not based on security concerns , but comes due to & ldquo ; the opening of an International Criminal Court investigation .& rdquo ;
Sinijlawi finds it suspicious that & ldquo ; these organizations are leading the procedure in the ICC , where Gantz himself is the main target because he has been the chief of staff in 2014 .& rdquo ;
DCI - P
Founded in 1991 , DCI - P is a Palestinian child rights organization that provides legal support to Palestinian minors in the Israeli and military court systems .
& ldquo ; We reject the recent designation as another unjust action by Israeli authorities to criminalize and eliminate our lawful human rights and child protection work ,& rdquo ; said Khaled Quzmar , general director of Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine . & ldquo ; When years of delegitimization and disinformation campaigns against us have failed to silence our work , Israeli authorities now choose to escalate repressive tactics by labeling civil society organizations as terrorists .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; We & rsquo ; ve identified five or six different people at different levels of the organization that had been active in the PFLP ,& rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; One in particular was the coordinator of DCI - P & rsquo ; s Community Mobilization Unit , Hashem Abu Maria .& rdquo ;
Abu Maria was killed in a clash with the IDF in 2014 and , according to NGO Monitor , was called & ldquo ; a leader & rdquo ; by PFLP .
The designation is not the first time that DCI - P has faced charges of terrorism . Citibank and Arab Bank PLC reportedly ceased providing services to DCI - P over PFLP links in 2018 .
Addameer
The Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association , established in 1991 , works and advocates for Palestinians in Israeli prisons , & ldquo ; offers free legal aid to political prisoners ,& rdquo ; and runs social campaigns .
& ldquo ; They defend mostly PFLP , the people who are accused in the Israeli legal process ,& rdquo ; Steinberg noted .& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The designations represent an unprecedented & amp ; ominous attempt by the Israeli occupying authorities to silence and criminalize Palestinian CSOs that challenge Israel & rsquo ; s prolonged military occupation ,& rdquo ; Addameer tweeted .
According to Steinberg , Addameer & ldquo ; have a number of staff members who are connected to PFLP . The founder , ( Abdul - Latif Ghait ) was a member and activist . The former vice chairman ... Khalida Jarrar ... she is defined as the head of the PFLP operations in the West Bank .& rdquo ; NGO Monitor claims to have identified at least five other PFLP members in Addameer & rsquo ; s ranks .
Bisan Center
The Bisan Center for Research and Development specializes in socioeconomic rights and community engagement .& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; It should be noted that Bisan Center for Research and Development is an independent , nonpartisan center that is not affiliated with any political entity ,& rdquo ; Bisan said in a statement on its Facebook page .
& ldquo ; This announcement [ of the terrorist designation ] comes after concerted efforts in the Israeli occupation & rsquo ; s attempts in a defamation campaign led by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs ,& rdquo ; it continued .
& ldquo ; The most recent [ Bisan ] executive director ... was sentenced for 12 months for recruiting activists ,& rdquo ; said Steinberg .& nbsp ;
Ataraf Rimawi , identified by NGO Monitor as Bisan & rsquo ; s previous executive director , was noted in a court ruling as a & ldquo ; PFLP member & rdquo ; who & ldquo ; posed a security threat .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
UPWC
The UPWC is & ldquo ; a progressive mass feminist organization that was established in 1980 ,& rdquo ; according to its website .
& ldquo ; And they have five individuals that we & rsquo ; ve identified on the payroll as PFLP people ,& rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; One of the founders of the PFLP ... was the president of the UPWC . So again , the connection there is pretty strong between [ the UPWC and ] the PFLP .& rdquo ;
Israel is not the first to identify UPWC as a PFLP arm . In 2015 , Fatah identified the UPWC as a PFLP affiliate , as did USAID in 1993 .
UAWC
Among the largest agricultural institutions in Palestinian society , UAWC was established in 1986 to promote Palestinian agricultural development .
& ldquo ; They run agricultural projects in Gaza and in the West Bank ,& rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; And that & rsquo ; s their excuse . That & rsquo ; s the justification for the large amounts of funding . They get millions from many different European countries .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; UAWC rejects and condemns Israel & rsquo ; s unsubstantiated allegations directed at UAWC and the other NGOs , which are politically motivated . It is telling that the Israeli government refuses to release any & lsquo ; evidence & rsquo ; substantiating these allegations ,& rdquo ; the NGO told The Jerusalem Post .
& ldquo ; We have identified seven [ PFLP - affiliated ] individuals that have various positions [ in UAWC ],& rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; A number of them have been sentenced in Israel , and , of course , Samir Arbid is standing trial ; he was their accountant .& rdquo ;
Arbid and Razak Farraj , another UAWC member , were arrested for their roles in the 2019 terrorist attack that killed Rina Schnerb .
& ldquo ; There are hundreds of employees who have worked and continue to work at UAWC and thousands of volunteers ,& rdquo ; said a UAWC representative . & ldquo ; UAWC , like any other organization , is not responsible for any individual action of any former and current employees .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; We should not forget that Arbid and Farraj have been exposed to horrifying torture to pressure them to give confessions ,& rdquo ; said the representative .
As with UPWC , Fatah and USAID documented that UAWC is a PFLP affiliate . NGO Monitor has further noted that due to Arbid & rsquo ; s and Farraj & rsquo ; s affiliations , the Netherlands suspended funding to the organization .& nbsp ;
The UAWC representative asserted that the funding was suspended only because of & ldquo ; NGO Monitor & rsquo ; s large incitement campaigns against UAWC .& rdquo ;& nbsp ;
The representative dismissed the USAID designation , saying that the USAID & ldquo ; report [ in which UAWC was designated a PFLP affiliate ] was published before the arrival of the Palestinian Authority , and it is a report that talks about the beginnings of UAWC and its work , which was all voluntary .& rdquo ;
A few bad eggs ?
The main evidence for proponents of the designation doesn & rsquo ; t come from the government , but from NGO investigations showing overlap of PFLP members within civil society .& nbsp ;
Sinijlawi argues that there are a few flaws in perceiving NGOs as terrorist organizations based on a few individuals .
The NGO could be unaware it has terrorists in its ranks . & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think that , by law , any NGO needs to get a security clearance for any person to get employed . If somebody submits the CV and he & rsquo ; s qualified for a job , he gets it .& rdquo ;
Even if the NGOs were aware , while some countries do not differentiate between military and political wings , these NGOs may have .
& ldquo ; There could be a military wing inside the Popular Front , but it does not mean that every student activist ... is involved in a certain type of violence or military action .& rdquo ;
While some of the NGOs may have had violent actors , & ldquo ; it does not mean that this organization is totally involved into terrorism ,& rdquo ; said Sinijlawi . & ldquo ; To blame the whole people because of someone related directly or indirectly to these NGOs ... it & rsquo ; s a trick that anybody will buy .& rdquo ;
& ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not just that they & rsquo ; re members ... it & rsquo ; s high - level staff ,& rdquo ; said Steinberg , dismissing that it & rsquo ; s a few bad eggs & ndash ; & ldquo ; in some cases , the heads of the organization , the people who control the money .& rdquo ;
Besides the pattern of NGO employees being PFLP operatives , Steinberg noted , PFLP / NGO activists often hold multiple positions in different NGOs , including in umbrella organizations .
& ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s a broader framework called PNGO , Palestinian NGO umbrella Organization . These organizations are all members of the PNGO , and the head of the PNGO generally has been a PFLP official .& rdquo ;
NGO or terrorism ?
& ldquo ; What does anybody mean by Palestinian & lsquo ; civil society ,& rsquo ; particularly when these organizations are very clearly part of a network which is not just terrorists , but it & rsquo ; s also part of the PLO structure ?& rdquo ; Steinberg asks . & ldquo ; What makes these organizations civil society ?& rdquo ;
The NGOs & ldquo ; are very important for Palestinians ,& rdquo ; said Sinijlawi . The designation is tantamount to & ldquo ; shutting down the democratic dynamics inside Palestinian society .& rdquo ;
On its part , PFLP has not disputed its connection to the NGOs .& nbsp ;
PFLP political bureau & rsquo ; s Kayed al - Ghoul has said that Palestinians are & ldquo ; proud of the affiliation of any of their sons with any national faction that resists the occupation , including the & rdquo ; PFLP .
The negative reaction to the terrorism designations shows how important these organizations are to Palestinians and their allies .& nbsp ;
Years of terrorist activity in the midst of Palestinian NGOs shows that when it comes to terrorists in their ranks , the prevailing sentiment in the response from the international community , Palestinian activists , and international bodies is that you need to break a few bad eggs to make an omelet . The two realities may not be so irreconcilable . The NGOs and the terrorist groups are interconnected , and while Palestinian civil society may be under attack & ndash ; that may also be legitimate .& bull ;
