The tensions and clashes in Jerusalem , particularly the videos from Friday night showing Israeli police in al - Aqsa Mosque , have led to the first condemnations of Israel from the country & rsquo ; s new Gulf partners .
& nbsp ;
Bahrain condemned Israeli forces for the & ldquo ; attack on worshipers at al - Aqsa Mosque .& rdquo ; The UAE has called on Israel to de - escalate tensions in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah .
& nbsp ;
Bahrain also has been concerned about the evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah . It doesn & rsquo ; t want the peace process or stability in the region undermined , and it wants provocations to stop . It wants tensions reduced as Ramadan concludes after a difficult month of clashes .
& nbsp ;
The statements came as Saudi Arabia said it & ldquo ; rejects Israel & rsquo ; s plans and measures to evict dozens of Palestinians from their homes in Jerusalem and impose Israeli sovereignty over them .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The triumvirate of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and the UAE is important because it is largely accepted that Riyadh gave the green light to Manama and Abu Dhabi to make peace last year . The Emirates went first , for various reasons , even though Bahrain had long considered a peace deal and was pushing coexistence for years .
& nbsp ;
The UAE made the first unprecedented flights with humanitarian aid during COVID - 19 in the spring of 2020 . Then its ambassador to Washington , Yousef al - Otaiba , wrote an op - ed in Yediot Aharonot . Peace followed soon after as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed down from & ldquo ; annexation & rdquo ; of the West Bank .
& nbsp ;
However , the peace deals , which moved quickly in August and September , hit some hurdles . There were questions about F - 35 sales , and US president Donald Trump lost the election in the US . This took the wind out of the sails of Saudi Arabia & rsquo ; s considerations and of several other countries that might have jumped on the peace wagon .
& nbsp ;
There were considerations about reconciliation after years in which countries had a transactional relationship with the Trump administration . Under Trump , Washington had signaled that human rights were not an issue . There was no pressure on Israel regarding Palestinian issues . On the contrary , there was a & ldquo ; peace to prosperity & rdquo ; plan .
& nbsp ;
The plan was unveiled on January 27 , 2020 , but aspects of it had been pushed in 2019 . The US Embassy had been moved in 2018 . Palestinians lost funding and were sidelined . The Jordanian king even went to Turkey for a meeting , and he had hoped Trump would reconsider the embassy move .
& nbsp ;
BY 2020 , things were moving in favor of the peace deals , with key work from Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz . But calculations have changed in 2021 .
& nbsp ;
Human - rights groups have made a new push to condemn Israel for & ldquo ; apartheid .& rdquo ; There have been calls on the Biden administration to pressure Israel . Former CIA director John Brennan and others have led the push , along with critical voices in Congress .
& nbsp ;
Meanwhile , Netanyahu sought to fly to the UAE for a quick trip to show off the new relations while in the midst of an election campaign . Having twice canceled the trip during the pandemic , he had to cancel again on March 11 , claiming Jordan had prevented a stopover . Embarrassment followed as voices in the UAE expressed concern that they were being embroiled in Israeli politics .
& nbsp ;
Then came the Jerusalem tensions . Failed attempts at Palestinian elections and the beginning of Ramadan coincided with Israel & rsquo ; s elections on March 23 . Ramadan began on April 21 , and with it came clashes .
& nbsp ;
Nevertheless , the positive relations with the Gulf have continued . UAE Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja penned an op - ed at Yediot about his first month in Israel .
& nbsp ;
However , the scenes at al - Aqsa Mosque last Friday were the kind that cause tensions in the region . Iran , Hezbollah and Hamas had slammed Israel in the days leading up to the clashes . Turkey and Qatar were preparing statements to slam Israel . The US was expressing concern and demanding de - escalation . European countries were following the tensions closely .
& nbsp ;
Instead of listening and trying to reduce the clashes , Israeli security forces waded into them . Whether that was due to political uncertainty in Israel , with Netanyahu & rsquo ; s rivals gaining in influence , or other issues was not clear .
& nbsp ;
The security cabinet met for the first time in months on April 18 . A new crisis after shooting attacks in the West Bank has led Israel to bolster forces . Hamas has fired rockets and threatens more . Israel is holding a large drill preparing for a multifront conflict .
& nbsp ;
COULD GULF ties be strained by this convergence of troubles ? So far , the statements are what was to be expected : concern and some mild condemnation ; a desire for stability and for Israel to listen . The question is whether Israel will listen .
& nbsp ;
Israel & rsquo ; s relatively cold official relations with Jordan and Egypt , combined with good security relations that largely go unnoticed , are the opposite of the positive ties and human - to - human connections with the Gulf that saw Israelis flock to the region to take part in conferences and discuss business deals .
& nbsp ;
However , voices in the UAE cautioned Israel about expecting too much and moving too fast . They certainly were wary of being used for a two - hour photo op by Netanyahu before an election .
& nbsp ;
Some Israeli right - wing voices in Israel , accustomed to slamming Arab states and never listening to regional voices , have paid lip service to peace with the Gulf . But they still show little interest in listening or taking to heart the need to reduce tensions in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
Outside of the statements and Jerusalem clashes , Israel and its peace partners in the Gulf have much to work on regarding wider issues , such as regional strategy and ties with Greece . There are new deals and initiatives moving forward .
& nbsp ;
There is coexistence . However , the Jerusalem tensions are the kind that require sensitive handling and showing respect for the concerns of others , a type of language that Jerusalem has not often used in recent years .
& nbsp ;
With a new administration in the White House , electoral uncertainty in Israel , and Iran , Turkey , Hamas and Hezbollah chomping at the bit for a showdown with the Jewish state , many challenges are in the air , of which the Gulf & rsquo ; s concerns about Jerusalem are just one .
