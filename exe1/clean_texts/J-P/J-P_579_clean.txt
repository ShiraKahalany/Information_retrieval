Jerusalem & rsquo ; s annual SlutWalk will take place on Friday morning in protest of rape culture and victim blaming for the 12th year , organizers announced . SlutWalk is a global movement that was born in 2011 when a Canadian police officer said that women & ldquo ; should avoid dressing like sluts & rdquo ; if they do not want to be victims of sexual violence . Participants in the demonstrations often dress in clothing that some consider revealing , and event organizers emphasize that there is no dress code . To adjust the event to the difficult times that the country is facing , the walk will be held in a different format this year , said organizers , with participants gathering at Zion Square in Jerusalem for a ceremony in which they will read out the names of the women who were murdered this year , before gathering at a local bar for speeches and discussion circles . More needed than ever & ldquo ; This year , sexual violence and gender - based violence are closing in on us from all directions and we need the march more than ever ,& rdquo ; said the organizers . & ldquo ; It was not simple for us to organize the march this year when there is so much pain and so many causes to fight for around us . Alongside that , it was clear to us that we could not back down .& rdquo ;& ldquo ; So we are here & ndash ; here to voice our outcry , to hurt together , to demand another reality . We are here because sexual violence is still used as a weapon against us in so many ways ,& rdquo ; they said .& ldquo ; We are here to cry out against a government , a state , and a society that still has so much to fix . We are here demanding the security and basic respect that we deserve . Always , and especially now ,& rdquo ; they emphasized .
