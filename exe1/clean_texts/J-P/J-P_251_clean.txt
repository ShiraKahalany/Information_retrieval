Kuwaiti Public Works Minister Dr . Rana Abdullah Al - Fares issued an order on Saturday banning the entry of commercial vessels loaded with goods to and from Israel into Kuwaiti territorial waters , according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al Anba .
The order prohibits entry permits being requested for ships carrying goods to or from Israel , even if goods being carried from Israel are being brought to another country outside of Kuwait .
Under Kuwaiti law , individuals and companies cannot conclude agreements with organizations or persons living in Israel and cannot deal financially or commercially with persons who have an interest in Israel , even if they live outside Israel .
It is also illegal to import , exchange or possess any Israeli goods , commodities or products , whether received directly or indirectly . Products also cannot include any material from Israeli products .
Hamas issued a statement welcoming the decision on Saturday , calling on other countries to & ldquo ; follow the same approach & rdquo ; and restrict Israeli trade and maritime traffic .

When the Abraham Accords were signed last year , Kuwait & ndash ; a staunch opponent of Israel & ndash ; insisted that it would & ldquo ; be the last & rdquo ; to normalize relations with Israel .
On Wednesday , Kuwait & rsquo ; s permanent ambassador to the UN , Talal Al - Fassam , reiterated Kuwait & rsquo ; s support for the Palestinians , and condemned a recent visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog to the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron , saying it provoked the sentiments of Muslims worldwide , according to the Palestinian WAFA news agency .
In May , the Kuwaiti parliament passed a bill that would restrict any form of contact with Israel . Any expressions of sympathy with Israel would also be outlawed .
