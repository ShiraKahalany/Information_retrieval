The Palestinians do not believe that an Israeli government headed by Yamina head Naftali Bennett will advance the peace process with Israel because of his far - right political positions , but his hi - tech background as a software entrepreneur could open opportunities for economic cooperation between the two sides , a Palestinian official said on Thursday .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The man has proven that he is more right - wing than [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu ,& rdquo ; the official said referring to Bennett . & ldquo ; Therefore , we do not expect someone who supports annexation and settlement expansion to make any progress on the political track .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Asked if he thought there was hope for boosting economic ties between the Palestinians and Israel under a Bennett government , the official replied : & ldquo ; Absolutely . It seems the man has been very successful in his business career and has adopted a liberal approach on economic issues . We are ready to work with any Israeli leader who will help us strengthen our economy . But Bennett and other Israelis need to understand that the Palestinian issue is not just about the economy or improving the living conditions of people .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
A Palestinian businessman from Ramallah said that the Palestinians would & ldquo ; welcome & rdquo ; any plans for boosting the Palestinian economy , & ldquo ; even if they come from someone like Bennett , who is an extremist when it comes to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict . As a politician , Bennett is bad for the Palestinians . But if he wants to work with us on economic issues , we say ahlan wa sahlan ( welcome ).& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Palestinian Authority officials refused to publicly comment on the political drama in Israel and the prospects of Bennett heading the new government .
& nbsp ;
In private , however , some said they would be & ldquo ; more than happy & rdquo ; to see an end to the Netanyahu era .
& nbsp ;
The officials said that the PA was ready to deal with any Israeli government that believes in the two - state solution and the implementation of all United Nations resolutions pertaining to the Israeli - Arab conflict .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Palestinian Authority is closely following the political developments in Israel ,& rdquo ; said one official . & ldquo ; We are confident that the departure of Netanyahu and his extremist right - wing government will be good not only for the Palestinians , but for the Israelis as well .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Another Palestinian official said that the chances of reviving the stalled peace negotiations with Israel would be much higher once Netanyahu is out of office .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We are currently working with the Biden administration , the European Union , Egypt and Jordan to resume the political process & rdquo ; with Israel , the official said . & ldquo ; There is hope that these efforts will be successful under a new Israeli government . There is no real difference between Bennett and Netanyahu , but some elements of the new coalition are committed to the peace process .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Palestinian political analysts , meanwhile , said that they did not expect & ldquo ; real changes & rdquo ; toward the Palestinian issue under a Bennett - led government .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Bennett is dreaming of annexing parts of the West Bank and he is opposed to a Palestinian state ,& rdquo ; said political analyst Eyad al - Ahmed . & ldquo ; Those who think that the new government in Israel will change Israeli policies toward the Palestinians are deluding themselves .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Ahmed said he and other analysts do not share the view that Bennett could promote economic cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians . & ldquo ; You can & rsquo ; t promote economic cooperation when you hold hostile views toward the Palestinians ,& rdquo ; he remarked .
& nbsp ;
Sufian Abu Zaida , a senior official with the ruling Fatah faction and former PA prisoners affairs minister , said that the new government will avoid making decisions related to the conflict with the Palestinians and instead & ldquo ; focus on fixing what Netanyahu destroyed internally .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas officials said that the Palestinians are not banking on any government in Israel .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Our Palestinian people do not count on any Israeli government ,& rdquo ; said Hamas official Ezzat al - Risheq . & ldquo ; We only rely on our resistance and unity to extract our rights .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said that his group does not differentiate between Israeli politicians .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; They are all the product of a Zionist project ,& rdquo ; Barhoum said . & ldquo ; The new government will not change the nature of the conflict with the occupier .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Meanwhile , several Palestinians and Arabs denounced Mansour Abbas , head of the Ra & rsquo ; am ( United Arab List ) Party , for signing an agreement to support the new coalition .
& nbsp ;
Arabs from the Gulf states described Abbas as the & ldquo ; head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Israel ,& rdquo ; and accused him of hypocrisy for supporting the new coalition . Palestinians described the agreement Abbas reached with the coalition as & ldquo ; shameful .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; In the Israeli political circus , there is a clown named Mansour Abbas ,& rdquo ; commented Palestinian political analyst Yousef Zaatreh . & ldquo ; He leads a group called the Islamic Movement . This is far from the reality . In fact , it is the remnants of the movement headed by Sheikh Raed Salah . Mansour Abbas is worse than [ PA President ] Mahmoud Abbas .& rdquo ;
