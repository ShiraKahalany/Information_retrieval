There is & ldquo ; no excuse & rdquo ; for an American president to block aid to Israel , Rep . Elise Stefanik , the Republican of New York & rsquo ; s 21st congressional district , said at a meeting of the Knesset Caucus for Jewish and Pro - Israel Students on Campuses Around the World on Sunday .& ldquo ; I have been clear at home and I will be clear here : There is no excuse for an American president to block aid to Israel & ndash ; aid that was duly passed by the Congress & ndash ; or to ease sanctions on Iran , paying a $ 6 billion ransom to the world & rsquo ; s leading state sponsor of terror , or to dither and hide while our friends fight for their lives . No excuse . Full stop ,& rdquo ; she said . According to Stefanik , the fight against Hamas was one of & ldquo ; good versus evil , civilization versus barbarism , and humanity versus depravity .& rdquo ; She said that the majority of American citizens stood behind Israel . The representative said that there could be no excuse for Hamas to regroup and that Israel must carry out & ldquo ; total victory .& rdquo ; The war wasn & rsquo ; t just Israel & rsquo ; s & ndash ; it was a war on the way of life in the West , she said . Support for Israel without equivocationsStefanik said that her backing of Israel was unequivocal .& ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s why I have sponsored , or backed , every measure to aid Israel that has come before the US Congress & ndash ; every single one .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; It was also why Stefanik , for years , had been & ldquo ; a leading proponent and partner to [ former ] President [ Donald ] Trump in his historic support for Israeli independence and security .& rdquo ;& nbsp ; Stefanik mentioned three moves by Trump : the Abraham Accords , which she said was the most significant move toward peace in a quarter century ; placing Israel under America & rsquo ; s Central Command ( CENTCOM ), which allowed for greater security coordination ; and the & ldquo ; wise decision & rdquo ; to cease funding to UNWRA .& ldquo ; If I leave you with one message today , it & rsquo ; s this : The majority of Americans support you , and we always will & ndash ; since President Truman & rsquo ; s recognition of Israel 11 minutes after David Ben - Gurion declared Israel & rsquo ; s independence 76 years and five days ago , America stands with Israel ,& rdquo ; Stefanik said .& ldquo ; We must not let the extremism in & lsquo ; elite & rsquo ; corners conceal the deep , abiding love for Israel among the American people ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; Most Americans feel a strong connection to your people . They have opened their hearts to you in this dark hour .& rdquo ; The caucus co - chairs are Likud MK Dan Illouz and Yesh Atid MK Moshe Turpaz . Illouz , in his speech , commended Stefanik & rsquo ; s viral hearing in Congress in which presidents of Harvard , MIT , and Penn said that whether calling for the genocide of the Jewish people violated campus protocols depended on context . He also said that earlier this month , Columbia tried to block a speech of his on campus by heaping bureaucracy on the process . Illouz said that some presidents on US campuses had aligned themselves with evil , while Stefanik aligned herself with good . Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana , in his speech at the caucus meeting , called the protesters on US campuses & ldquo ; mass mobs & rdquo ; and accused them of trying to & ldquo ; terrorize & rdquo ; their college management & ldquo ; into submission .& rdquo ; Ohana argued that behind calls for a ceasefire in Gaza , there was an attempt to normalize violence against Jews . Stefanik , Ohana said , spoke & ldquo ; truth to power & rdquo ; in the viral hearing , which he called & ldquo ; historic & rdquo ; and a & ldquo ; turning point in the struggle over the soul of world universities .& rdquo ; Ohana presented a map of Palestine in a kindergarten from Khan Yunis in Gaza that showed the entire land of Israel , arguing that this was the real meaning of the slogan & ldquo ; from the river to the sea & rdquo ; and showing that Hamas wished to wipe Israel off the map .
