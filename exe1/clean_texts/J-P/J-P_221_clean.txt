For most Israelis , Amir Khoury , a Christian Arab , is a hero . Khoury is the policeman who gave chase earlier this month and helped stop & ndash ; at the cost of his life & ndash ; the terrorist in Bnei Brak before he could kill more than the four innocent civilians he had already slain in cold blood . The Bnei Brak Municipality announced on Sunday that a street in the haredi city would be named after Khoury . Khoury & rsquo ; s father , Jeries , who also served in the police , reacted to the gesture by saying , & ldquo ; We are seeing unity [ between Arabs and Jews ] that we have not seen for years .& rdquo ; For Ayman Odeh , head of the Joint List , Khoury is a humiliation . Why ? Because he served in Israel & rsquo ; s security forces . In a Ramadan greeting Odeh uploaded to Facebook from Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate , where he said he hoped to one day see Palestinian flags flying , Odeh & ndash ; known to complain that the Israeli police do not do enough to stem crime in the Arab sector & ndash ; said all those serving in Israel & rsquo ; s security forces should & ldquo ; throw your guns in their faces and tell them our place is not with you .& rdquo ; Odeh said he has met with groups of & ldquo ; young Palestinians with Israeli citizenship & rdquo ; from & ldquo ; occupied Arab Jerusalem & rdquo ; who have said they were being harmed and humiliated by the security forces .& ldquo ; It is important for me to tell you from here , the Damascus Gate , that it is a humiliation for one of our sons to join the security forces ,& rdquo ; he said . Odeh then called on a & ldquo ; small minority & rdquo ; of Arabs who have enlisted & ndash ; he put the number at a few thousand & ndash ; to leave their jobs . He said they were & ldquo ; humiliating our people , humiliating our families , and humiliating everyone who comes to pray in the blessed Aqsa Mosque .& rdquo ; So Khoury , for Odeh , is a disgrace . And the historic unity that Khoury & rsquo ; s father spoke about is , for Odeh and his Joint List , a political liability . This is a party that thrives on creating divisions and enmity between Jews and Arabs , not on fostering any kind of integration and unity . At a time of galloping terrorism , of citizens being shot and stabbed in city streets by fanatics whose terrorist methodology is used not only to kill Jews in Israel , but thousands upon thousands of Muslims around the world , Odeh & rsquo ; s message is that those Arabs who are engaged in a battle against this indiscriminate murder are & ldquo ; humiliating & rdquo ; their people . There are many messages Odeh could have delivered on the occasion of Ramadan . He could have gone for the traditional : & ldquo ; May the crescent - shaped moon of Ramadan brighten your path toward enlightenment .& rdquo ; Or for the more spiritual , & ldquo ; Ramadan is the month to seek forgiveness for our sins , may Allah accept our prayers and pardon our wrongdoings .& rdquo ; He could have opted to spend his two - and - a - half - minute video talking about how the deprivation of the body during Ramadan is a time to concentrate on bettering the soul and on becoming a better person . Instead , what was the message of the leader of the largest Arab party in the Knesset ? That Arabs should not serve in the country & rsquo ; s security forces & ndash ; security forces that also protect them . Odeh , who likes to fashion himself as an Israeli Palestinian Martin Luther King , had a message not of harmony but rather of division , of perpetual conflict & ndash ; anything but conciliation , anything but Arabs and Jews living side by side in this country , sharing the space equitably and shouldering part of the responsibility for keeping that space safe . While Ra & rsquo ; am Party head Mansour Abbas , Odeh & rsquo ; s political rival , is trying to improve the lot of the country & rsquo ; s Arab minority by working with Israel and Israelis , Odeh continues to sow nothing but division and enmity . Religious Zionist Party MK Itamar Ben - Gvir has been rightly accused since the onset of this most recent wave of violence of & ldquo ; dancing on the blood & rdquo ; of the victims , of going to the sites of some of the attacks and firing up the crowds , tapping into the rage caused by the terrorism to win new followers . Odeh is doing the same thing . The terrorism , and the IDF & rsquo ; s response to it , are Odeh & rsquo ; s cue to fan the flames . Sadly , that seems to be his only political ticket : what Odeh wants to do is make sure the Israeli - Arab conflict endures . He sees an opportunity to ensure that the discourse between Arab and Jew in this land is not one of integration , one of working within the system to get more for Arab - Israelis , issues that his rival Mansour Abbas speaks about ; rather , he wants the emphasis to be on the Aqsa Mosque and Palestinian nationalism . Odeh can & rsquo ; t compete with Abbas on the integration card , on improving the daily lives of Arab - Israelis , so he needs to keep in the forefront the violence and the conflict and the & ldquo ; occupation .& rdquo ; The & ldquo ; historic unity & rdquo ; that Jeries Khoury talked about is not the stuff that Odeh can cash in on at the ballot box . Odeh & rsquo ; s political oxygen is only conflict and the & ldquo ; evils of Zionism .& rdquo ; This , he believes , is what resonates with his voters , and this is why he must forever put that at the forefront and look for reasons & ndash ; such as the recent wave of terrorism and the IDF & rsquo ; s reaction & ndash ; to keep it there .
