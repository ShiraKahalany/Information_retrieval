Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday night that the Palestinian elections have been postponed until Israel allows the vote to take place in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
Abbas made the announcement after a meeting of leaders of Palestinian factions in Ramallah .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We have decided to postpone the parliamentary elections until we ensure the participation of the people of Jerusalem ,& rdquo ; Abbas said in a statement . & ldquo ; The elections must be held in all the Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
He said that he will work toward forming a Palestinian national unity government that would & ldquo ; abide by international resolutions and reinforce the PLO .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Earlier in the night , Abbas announced that Israel has informed the Palestinian Authority that it will not allow the Palestinians to hold elections in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; There will be no elections without Jerusalem ,& rdquo ; Abbas said in opening remarks during a meeting of leaders of several Palestinian factions in Ramallah .
& nbsp ;
The meeting was called amid reports that Abbas was set to announce the postponement of the elections indefinitely because of Israel & rsquo ; s reported refusal to allow the vote to take place in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;& nbsp ;
He said that the US , European Union and some Arab countries also informed the Palestinians of Israel & rsquo ; s refusal to allow the elections to take place in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; Today , we received a message from Israel , the US and some Arab countries about Israel & rsquo ; s opposition to holding the elections in Jerusalem ,& rdquo ; Abbas said . & ldquo ; The message we received said that Israel can @@@ t make a decision because there is no government in Israel .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Scoffing at the purported Israeli response , Abbas said : & ldquo ; But there is a government in Israel that is making decisions to build thousands of settlements . Who issued the order to the [ Israel ] police to stand with the settlers in killing the people of Jerusalem ? Where did these decisions came from ? Africa ? We won & rsquo ; t allow anyone to fool us . This is nonsense . Where is [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu ? Netanyahu , may God prolong his life , is still the prime minister .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Abbas said that the Palestinians are ready to hold the elections once Israel agrees to allow the vote to take place in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; We want the elections to take place in Jerusalem , and not in Abu Dis ,& rdquo ; he said , referring to a West Bank village south of Jerusalem . & ldquo ; For us , the elections are not a tactic or a game .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Abbas said that the EU made a big effort to exert pressure on Israel to allow the elections to take place in Jerusalem , but to no avail .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; When we announced the elections , the Europeans told us that they support us and are ready to help us achieve our goal ,& rdquo ; he noted . & ldquo ; I told the Europeans that that Israel will not agree to hold the elections in Jerusalem . They told me that they will talk to the Israelis about this . We also asked the Americans where are they , but we didn & rsquo ; t hear from them . We waited and didn & rsquo ; t receive a response . We also sent our foreign minister to Europe to tell them we are running out of time .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
According to Abbas , the heads of the EU told him that they were & ldquo ; frustrated & rdquo ; by Israel & rsquo ; s refusal to respond to the request to hold the elections in Jerusalem .
& nbsp ;
Abbas accused Israel of & ldquo ; beating & rdquo ; Palestinian candidates in Jerusalem and preventing election gatherings .
& nbsp ;
He went on to praise the residents of east Jerusalem for protesting Israeli security restrictions in the city in the past three weeks .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; I want to praise the great stance of our people in Jerusalem and the Arab people who stood with us regarding the events in Jerusalem in the past few weeks ,& rdquo ; Abbas said . & ldquo ; There is a great people in Jerusalem capable of saying no to the occupation .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
He accused the Israeli government of supporting Jewish extremists who chanted & quot ; Death to the Arabs & quot ; during a recent demonstration near the Old City of Jerusalem .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Referring to the removal of the police barricades from Damascus Gate & ndash ; which reportedly triggered the clashes in the city & ndash ; Abbas said : & ldquo ; Jerusalem belongs to us ; our brothers managed to remove the barricades that prevented them from moving and working in the city . They launched a peaceful , popular resistance . This is the only way to confront this aggression on our people . Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Palestine .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Earlier this week , Foreign Ministry political adviser Alon Bar told European ambassadors that Israel was not interfering with the scheduled Palestinian elections . & ldquo ; Israel will not prevent the elections in the Palestinian Authority from happening ,& rdquo ; Bar said . The Palestinian elections are an internal Palestinian matter , and Israel will not intervene , he added .
& nbsp ;
Hamas officials said they did not participate in the meeting of the faction leaders because they received an invitation only at the last minute . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s position is clear : we reject the postponement of the elections and we will not provide a cover for such a decision ,& rdquo ; said Mohammed Subha , a spokesperson for the Hamas electoral list & ldquo ; Jerusalem is Our Destiny .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Subha warned that postponement of the elections would have a negative impact on efforts to end the rivalry between Hamas and Fatah . He also hinted that the move could trigger widespread protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
& nbsp ;
Hours before the meeting , thousands of Palestinians demonstrated in the Gaza Strip to voice opposition to the cancellation of the elections .
& nbsp ;
Some of the protests were organized by supporters of exiled Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan , an archrival of Abbas . Dahlan loyalists have formed an electoral list called Al - Mustaqbal ( Future ) to contest the parliamentary elections .
& nbsp ;
Nayrouz Qarmout , a spokeswoman for Al - Mustaqbal , pointed out that 25 electoral lists running in the parliamentary elections were opposed to the cancellation of the vote . & ldquo ; No one has the right to postpone the elections ,& rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; Only those who are afraid of the results don & rsquo ; t want elections .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
Qarmout and other Palestinians predicted that the cancellation of the elections would intensify the dispute between Fatah and Hamas .
& nbsp ;
In a joint statement , the electoral lists warned that the cancellation of the elections would be a & ldquo ; constitutional crime .& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The cancellation of the elections is a new and big catastrophe for the Palestinians ,& rdquo ; said Abdel Hakim Awad , a senior official with Dahlan & rsquo ; s Democratic Reform Current movement . & ldquo ; It will have dire effects and serious consequences on the Palestinian people . The elections are a light at the end of the tunnel in order to unify the Palestinian people and end the division [ between the West Bank and Gaza Strip ].& rdquo ;
& nbsp ;
The decision to hold the elections was part of an agreement reached between Fatah , Hamas and 12 other Palestinian factions .
& nbsp ;
The agreement , reached under the auspices of Egypt , called for boosting public freedoms in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , including the immediate release of detainees held by the PA and Hamas and non - interference by the Palestinian security forces in the electoral process .
& nbsp ;
The agreement was reached after months of negotiations , which began in July 2020 between Fatah and Hamas leaders in Turkey , Qatar and Egypt .
& nbsp ;
In accordance with the agreement , Abbas issued a decree on January 15 for holding the first general elections since 2006 , when Hamas won the parliamentary vote .
& nbsp ;
& ldquo ; The Palestinian people in Jerusalem and all constituencies of the nation are invited to general , free and direct elections to elect members of the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) on May 22 , 2021 and President of the State of Palestine on July 31 , 2021 ,& rdquo ; Abbas said in the decree .
& nbsp ;
According to the decree , the PLC elections shall be considered the first stage for the election of the Palestinian National Council ( PNC ), the PLO & rsquo ; s legislative body . The formation of the PNC shall be completed on August 31 , 2021 .
& nbsp ;
The Palestinian Central Elections Commission said that 36 electoral lists submitted their nomination applications for the PLC elections , including 29 independent lists and seven from political parties . The number of candidates nominated for the 132 - member PLC reached 1 , 391 , including 405 women .
