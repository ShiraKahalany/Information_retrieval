Hezbollah @@@ s deputy secretary - general Sheikh Naim Qassem has claimed that Hezbollah forces in Lebanon knew about the IDF attacks on the underground & quot ; Metro & quot ; tunnels in Gaza during Operation Guardian of the Walls , according to Lebanese news channel Almanar .

This statement was part of a larger interview that aired Thursday night on a television channel associated with the movement .
& nbsp ;
The Hezbollah official claimed to have known about the & quot ; ground operation propaganda ,& quot ; after having been informed about it by & quot ; intelligence coordination work & quot ; with Palestinians in Gaza .
& nbsp ;
During Operation Guardian of the Walls , Israel destroyed an underground network of tunnels known as & quot ; the Metro & quot ; and supposedly did this by diverting international attention away with incorrect information about an imminent ground invasion , which they hoped would drive Hamas fighters underground into the tunnels .
& nbsp ;
The misinformation worked , although the plan was not carried out to completion and the number of dead was less than expected .
& nbsp ;
During the military operation , a number of rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon , although Hezbollah did not claim responsibility for any of them .& nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Additionally , A Hezbollah member was killed by IDF fire when protesters tried to storm the border with Lebanon and Israel during the operation .
