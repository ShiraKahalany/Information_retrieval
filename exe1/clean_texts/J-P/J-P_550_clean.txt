Hundreds of Jerusalem women have taken to social media in the name of the & ldquo ; silent majority & rdquo ; to protest the violence and civil disobedience that has taken over Israel & rsquo ; s mixed cities in recent days .

The & ldquo ; Not in My Name & rdquo ; campaign was launched Thursday night across Facebook , with images of women holding their hands up with the phrase written in Hebrew , English or Arabic .

& ldquo ; This was coming from an extreme desire & ndash ; after seeing image after image of violent men in the streets as the face of the internal , civil , local uprising & ndash ; and wondering if a female voice could not be a contrast to this ,& rdquo ; said Ariel Markose , who helped spearhead the project . & ldquo ; This was the focus of the campaign : the opposite image , the opposite message .& rdquo ;

& ldquo ; These people don & rsquo ; t speak for me , this is not in my name ,& rdquo ; she continued . & ldquo ; Civil violence is not the answer , no matter what side you are on .& rdquo ;

 

& nbsp ;
A resident of Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Katamonim neighborhood , Markose said the idea was sparked by a social media message posted by her friend Heftzi Zion Moses that called out the silence of the moderate majority .

That post led to a phone call between the friends , along with two others & ndash ; Eliraz Shifman Bergman and Anat Shwartz Weil & ndash ; and Rachel Azaria , formerly an MK in Moshe Kahlon & rsquo ; s Kulanu Party .

& nbsp ;
At first , the group envisioned a women & rsquo ; s protest but realized that such an effort might get lost amid the countless other riots across Israel . Moreover , they wanted to provide a space for women with children who might feel unsafe going out to protest .

The team started a WhatsApp group that in hours filled up with 300 participants ; they have now started a second one to help include more women who can share the message .

The Facebook posts are in all three languages and state , & ldquo ; Not in my Name ! Women of Jerusalem , from all sectors are saying not in our name . From the horrible events we are witnessing these days , we choose life and say no to violence . We call on all of you to join . This evening , together , we raise our hands to say , & lsquo ; Not in my Name .& rsquo ;& rdquo ;

The hashtag # NotInMyName and its Arabic and Hebrew counterparts have hundreds of posts and thousands of comments & ndash ; some supportive , others by extremists who posted death threats .

 & nbsp ;
& nbsp ;
Markose , who runs the Jerusalem Model project that brings together the city & rsquo ; s diverse social activists , said that she doesn & rsquo ; t know of Palestinian women who have shared the posts so far .

& ldquo ; In times of conflict for a Palestinian woman , expressing any political voice against violence and uprising is not a majority view and can be condemned by those around her to the point that it is scary ,& rdquo ; Markose said . & ldquo ; There is a tension between wanting to strike when there is momentum and making it perfectly equal and symmetrical . The value here is not symmetry .

& ldquo ; On the other hand , there is a strong community of local Jerusalem women who have energy and something to say ,& rdquo ; she said .

She added that the campaign is also apolitical and not meant to influence government policy .

& ldquo ; I hope we can do something great ,& rdquo ; Markose concluded .
