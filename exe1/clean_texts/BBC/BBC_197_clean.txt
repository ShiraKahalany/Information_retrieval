apple has been criticised after the palestinian flag emoji was automatically suggested to iphone users who type " jerusalem ." both israel and the palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city . tv presenter rachel riley , who is jewish , noted on social media that national flags were not suggested for other capitals . apple has told the bbc that the change - which followed a recent software update - was not intentional . the issue will be remedied in a future software update , apple says , but it is not known how rapidly this will happen . writing on x ( formerly twitter ), ms riley demanded that apple explain what had happened . " showing double standards with respect to israel is a form of antisemitism ", she argued . the issue , according to apple , relates to a feature called predictive emoji . iphones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages , and other apps . the notes accompanying the latest ios update say that it includes " new emojis ." the status of jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between israel and the palestinians . israel sees the whole of jerusalem as its eternal , undivided capital , while palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped - for future state . east jerusalem , along with the west bank and gaza strip , were captured by israel from jordan and egypt in a war in 1967 , and have since been viewed internationally as occupied palestinian territory . this is not the first time a big tech company has found itself embroiled in the bitter dispute between israel and the palestinians . last year rival tech giant meta had to apologise after a bug resulted in it adding " terrorist " to the biographies of some instagram users describing themselves as palestinian . meta said it fixed a problem " that briefly caused inappropriate arabic translations " in some of its products .
