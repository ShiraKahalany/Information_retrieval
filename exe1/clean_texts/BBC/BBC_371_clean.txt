the head of the un ' s largest aid agency in gaza says he is temporarily closing its headquarters in occupied east jerusalem after a number of attacks . philippe lazzarini said " israeli residents " twice set fire to the compound ' s perimeter on thursday evening . there were no casualties but the fire " caused extensive damage to the outdoor areas ," he wrote on social media . " once again , the lives of un staff were at a serious risk ." " our director with the help of other staff had to put out the fire themselves as it took the israeli fire extinguishers and police a while before they turned up ," he added . there was no immediate response from the israeli authorities . mr lazzarini also posted a video of what he said was a " crowd accompanied by armed men " who were chanting " burn down the united nations ". this video has not been verified by the bbc . he said it was the second time this week the compound has come under attack , and it would not be reopened until " proper security is restored ". also this week , unrwa said that it had reported 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys and bullying and harassment of un staff in a two - week period . israel has been highly critical of unrwa , accusing some of its staff members of involvement in the 7 october hamas attacks . the allegations led several international donors to temporarily halt their funding , although some have now resumed aid payments . an independent un review later ruled that israel was yet to provide " supporting evidence " for this claim . it also found unrwa needed to do more to improve its neutrality , staff vetting and transparency .
