three university leaders have testified before congress about their institutions ' responses to campus protests over the israel - gaza war . the leaders of northwestern , ucla and rutgers appeared before the house committee on education and the workforce . they defended some of the negotiations between students and schools during the protests and offered updates on how those involved were being disciplined . thursdayâ  s hearing was the latest in a series of appearances by university heads , and coincided with a new small camp being set up on uclaâ  s campus . thousands of students , at more than 130 colleges and universities across the us , demonstrated in opposition to the war in gaza . more than 3 , 000 demonstrators were arrested between april and may . the committee on thursday questioned the university heads on what concessions were made to get students to reduce or disband protest camps . committee members also sought answers on how antisemitism was being addressed in their institutions . all three were asked about how many students were disciplined for their behaviour : at northwestern none were suspended or expelled for antisemitism ; four people were suspended and 19 sanctioned at rutgers ; while ucla is evaluating more than 100 reported cases of antisemitism and islamophobia . michael schill , the president of northwestern , took the majority of questions . multiple republican committee members were critical of mr schill for reaching an agreement with protesters in exchange for them taking down the camp . rutgers reached a similar agreement . some democrats on the committee applauded mr schill for his peaceful handling of the matter : no arrests were made and the police were not called during the clearing of the camp . one of the most contentious moments of the three - hour - long hearing came from elise stefanik , a republican . ms stefanik cited multiple examples of alleged instances of antisemitism on northwestern ' s campus and asked mr schill how long the investigation into these instances would go on . " we believe , at northwestern , in due processâ , mr schill responded . the spotlight was on ucla chancellor gene block , whose university saw large protests and a camp that was attacked by counter - protesters . police and school officials were slow to respond to violence and were heavily criticised for their response last month . on wednesday , the police chief at ucla was temporarily removed and reassigned â  pending an examination of our security processesâ , the university said . in his opening remarks , mr block said the protesters had " tested the limitsâ  of the ucla administration ' s de - escalation strategy . he said his university strove to prevent using law enforcement to make arrests on campus â  unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of the communityâ . congresswoman ilhan omar , a democrat , accused mr block of not protecting pro - palestinian students by allowing counter - protesters to attack for hours . meanwhile , photos and videos showed a new small camp being built outside kerckhoff hall at ucla on thursday . protesters used tables , metal fences , and wooden boards to block off walkways , while security guards watched over them , according to cbs , the bbc ' s us partner . ucla vice chancellor for strategic communications told bbc news that the administration was " aware of the demonstration activity on the kerckhoff patio "." our safety personnel are on site and actively monitoring the situation ." a later statement issued by mr block and the ucla vice chancellor of campus safety said the administration " has withdrawn consent to remain on campus for the demonstrators ," and is " asking them to disperse immediately "." there is reasonable cause to find that demonstrators ' activities â  including erecting barricades , establishing fortifications , and blocking access to parts of the campus and buildings â  are disrupting campus operations ," the statement continued . " demonstrators have been informed that if they do not disperse , they will face arrest and possible disciplinary action ." some classes switched to remote learning due to the new protest on thursday , and los angeles police issued a citywide tactical alert , according to ktla - tv . the alerts are used to re - distribute on - duty police officers and prepare for a possible escalation that would trigger an emergency . at harvard university on thursday , over 1 , 000 graduating students stood up and left their commencement ceremony in protest after the administration barred 13 students from graduating due to their protest activities . members of the audience also booed the university president as he spoke , and palestinian flags were seen flying near the back of the crowd . previous hearings by the house of representatives committee have resulted in two ivy league university heads stepping down , though thursday ' s hearing had tense moments it was much less contentious than the previous committee hearings . the appearance of columbia university ' s president dr nemat shafik at an april congressional hearing emboldened students on campus and led to them pitching tents on a lawn , sparking a wave of protests across the us .
