a un team says there is " convincing information " that hostages held in gaza have been subjected to sexual violence including rape and sexualised torture . there were grounds to suspect the abuse was still ongoing , the un said . the un team also found " reasonable grounds to believe " sexual violence , including gang rape , took place when hamas attacked israel on 7 october . israel ' s foreign ministry said it welcomed the " definitive recognition that hamas committed sexual crimes ". the un security council should now designate hamas as a terrorist organisation and impose international sanctions on it , spokesman lior haiat said . hamas rejected the un report as " baseless and only aimed at demonising the palestinian resistance ". the group denies its gunmen sexually assaulted women during the attacks or mistreated female hostages they took to gaza . warning : contains graphic descriptions of rape and sexual violence pramila patten , the un ' s special representative on sexual violence in conflict , said her team had " found clear and convincing information that sexual violence , including rape , sexualised torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " had been committed against hostages . there were " reasonable grounds " to believe such violence could be " ongoing against those still held in captivity ", she told reporters . hamas gunmen infiltrated southern israel on 7 october - killing about 1 , 200 people and taking 253 others hostage . the un report said " the mission team found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict - related sexual violence occurred in multiple locations during the 7 october attacks ". these happened in at least three locations - the nova music festival site and its surroundings , road 232 , and kibbutz re ' im , it added . reports of sexual violence carried out by hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by israel , the uk and others - began to emerge soon after 7 october and have accumulated steadily ever since . the bbc has also seen and heard evidence of rape , sexual violence and mutilation of women . israel responded to the 7 october attack by launching a military campaign in gaza , during which 30 , 500 people have been killed , according to the hamas - run health ministry . the un team visited israel between 29 january and 14 february . the mission , led by ms patten along with nine experts , was not investigative in nature , but designed to gather and verify allegations , the un said . it added that 33 meetings were held with israeli representatives , and more than 5 , 000 photographic images were examined as well as 50 hours of video footage . the report said that " despite concerted efforts to encourage " victims to come forward , the team was unable to interview any of them . some allegations of rape and sexual violence were " unfounded ", the report explained , including the graphically publicised case of a pregnant woman whose womb was reportedly torn open and her foetus stabbed . other reports could not be verified due to limited imagery , the un said . it also said it had not been able to establish a discernible pattern of genital mutilation . the un report also said there had been allegations of sexual violence against palestinians in israeli custody , including " unwanted touching of intimate areas " and " prolonged forced nudity " in detention settings , during house raids and at checkpoints after 7 october . the report said that while no instances of rape against palestinians were reported , conservative cultural norms could have impeded reporting of sexual assault . israel ' s foreign ministry rejected this part of the report . " that is a derisive and deliberate palestinian manoeuvre aimed at creating an intolerable equivalence between the horrific crimes that were committed , and continue to be committed , by hamas and malicious and baseless claims made against israel and israelis ," mr haiat said . israel has rejected similar allegations made previously by a panel of independent un experts as " despicable and unfounded ". mr haiat also said israel opposed a recommendation made in the report that the country co - operate with the un ' s international commission of inquiry , which is trying to conduct an investigation into potential war crimes on all sides . he accused the inquiry of being hostile to israel . meanwhile , israeli foreign minister israel katz on monday recalled the country ' s ambassador to the un for " consultations ", accusing the un of an " attempt to silence the grave un report on the mass rapes ". he criticised un secretary general ant√≥nio guterres for not convening the security council to discuss the findings and in order to declare hamas a terrorist organisation . un spokesman stephane dujarric said that mr guterres " has fully supported " ms patten ' s work in her visit to israel . " in no way , shape or form did the secretary - general do anything to keep the report ' quiet '. in fact , the report is being presented publicly today ," mr dujarric said .
