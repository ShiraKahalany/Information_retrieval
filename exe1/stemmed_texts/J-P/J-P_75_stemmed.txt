the eurovis 2024 slogan is & ldquo ; unit by music , & rdquo ; but isra eurovis fan fear that the true slogan thi year may be & ldquo ; unit by hate and antisemit . & rdquo ; it wa never go to be easi for eden golan , israel & rsquo ; s contest , to compet in eurovis in 2024 dure the war with hama , but the fact that the intern song contest will be held thi year in malmo , sweden , consid to be one of the most antisemit citi in the world , ha made it infinit more complic and danger for israel to take part . & nbsp ; the war would have affect israel & rsquo ; s particip in ani citi , but last year , when sweden & rsquo ; s loreen won the competit with her song , & ldquo ; tattoo , & rdquo ; it guarante that the competit would move to malmo , sinc the contest is held in the home countri of the previou year & rsquo ; s winner . & nbsp ; a citi known for antisemit threat and harassmentmalmo , sweden & rsquo ; s third largest citi , is a port citi connect by the oresund bridg to copenhagen , but it locat , unfortun doe not ensur that it is cosmopolitan or toler . malmo ha a popul of a littl over 350 , 000 and there are about 100 , 000 muslim in the region . in recent year , the small jewish commun in the citi ha report seriou antisemit threat and harass from malmo & rsquo ; s muslim resid . isra eurovis contest have alway perform under heavi secur , but accord to multipl media report , secur measur have been heighten greatli in advanc of thi year & rsquo ; s contest , which will open on may 7 . & nbsp ; golan is set to perform in the semi - final on may 9 . she and the entir isra deleg & ndash ; consist of her dancer , musician , stylist , and other & ndash ; is said to have been told by the shin bet , israel & rsquo ; s secur servic , to stay in their malmo hotel room at all time , except when golan is actual perform . & nbsp ; while isra have alway need secur , past isra deleg to eurovis contest have had at least some opportun to mingl with the other deleg and enjoy the citi in which the contest ha been held , an import part of particip in an intern competit . but thi year , the focu will be on keep them safe to the exclus of everyth els in the wake of anti - war protest and threat . a recent report by keshet 12 new correspond ohad hemo and elad simchayoff on malmo reveal a disturb level of antisemit among the muslim popul of the citi . the report and their crew were threaten , assault , and spit on mani time by muslim resid of malmo who heard them speak hebrew . be film did not deter these harass . & nbsp ; one jewish resid of an upscal malmo neighborhood told the keshet correspond that she wa alert to the hama attack on the morn of octob 7 by hear cheer from the street that were so loud that they woke her . yair elsner , also a jewish malmo resid , told them that in the first week after octob 7 , he would walk from hi build to hi car carri a knife to protect himself . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; you go outsid and you see exactli the same peopl who did octob 7 , but here . there is no differ & ndash ; there is no reason to assum that they wouldn & rsquo ; t be abl to commit the same atroc on us here if onli they could , & rdquo ; he told them . & nbsp ; keshet report that seven out of 10 swedish jew testifi in a recent survey that their live had becom more difficult follow octob 7 and about half of them said they had consid or were consid leav the countri . perhap the most chill aspect of their report wa that guard at a malmo mosqu , who did not realiz that the keshet correspond were jewish , told them that they had heard there would be a bomb attack at eurovis and that everyon they knew wa go to stay away from malmo arena , where the contest will take place . & nbsp ; unfortun , antisemit in malmo is noth new . fourteen year ago , the simon wiesenth center issu a travel warn for jew to southern sweden and especi to malmo . in 2015 , a swedish journalist walk around the citi wear a kippah and a star of david had to stop film earlier than plan becaus so mani peopl threaten him , curs him , and threw egg at him . & nbsp ; in 2016 , danish jewish actor kim bodnia quit the hit detect seri , the bridg , which wa film in malmo and copenhagen , say in an interview , & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s not veri comfort to be [ in malmo ] as a jewish person . & rdquo ; it isn & rsquo ; t onli antisemit that is on the rise in sweden , but lawless in gener . accord to report , in 2022 , in stockholm , the number of gun murder wa 30 time higher than that of london . & ldquo ; these are difficult time for sweden , & rdquo ; olaf kristersson , the prime minist said . & ldquo ; sweden ha never seen anyth like thi befor & ndash ; no other countri in europ ha seen anyth like thi . & rdquo ; while sweden may have the reput of be a clean , prosper countri with great social servic such as health care and a high standard of live , in recent year , it ha been cope with an epidem of drug gang violenc that includ bomb and grenad attack . & nbsp ; in an articl headlin , & ldquo ; sweden & rsquo ; s new normal : bomb in the suburb on a weeknight & rdquo ; in politico , charl duxburi wrote in earli octob 2023 : & ldquo ; the upswel of [ gang ] violenc ha been so intens , widespread , and chaotic execut & ndash ; inexperienc teenag boy are often recruit to carri out the attack & ndash ; that there is a grow sens here that no one is safe from it . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; accord to the guardian , in 2023 there were 149 success bomb deton and 62 attempt bomb in sweden , in a countri with a total popul of about 10 . 5 million peopl . & nbsp ; the lawless and antisemit have combin to give isra secur the challeng of a lifetim , while the deleg will also have to cope with hostil from other eurovis contest . some artist have call for israel to be ban from eurovis , as russia wa follow it invas of ukrain , but the european broadcast union ( ebu ) , which run eurovis , ha reiter it stanc that it is a contest for broadcast , not govern , and that israel & rsquo ; s kan broadcast ha done noth wrong . & nbsp ; yet , despit the threat level , eden golan & rsquo ; s song , & ldquo ; hurrican & rdquo ; ha consist been in the top 10 in the eurovis bet tabl , consid a reliabl measur of success in the contest ; at presstim , & ldquo ; hurrican & rdquo ; wa in the seventh spot out of 37 countri . & nbsp ; israel & rsquo ; s origin choic for it song , & ldquo ; octob rain , & rdquo ; wa reject by the ebu . eurovis & rsquo ; s polici is that song should avoid specif polit content and the song wa seen as a comment on the hama massacr , which it unquestion wa . & nbsp ; the new song , & ldquo ; hurrican , & rdquo ; made the lyric vaguer , although the sentiment express is essenti the same . the music video releas for the song show golan sing at a locat that look much like the supernova music festiv , where about 10 % of the attende were murder and taken hostag on octob 7 , with dancer seemingli writh in agoni . & nbsp ; israel began take part in eurovis in 1973 , even though it is not in europ , sinc it would not have been welcom in a middl eastern region song contest . it took home the top prize in 1978 and 1979 with win for izhar cohen and the alphabeta for the song & ldquo ; a - ba - ni - bi , & rdquo ; and milk and honey for & ldquo ; hallelujah , & rdquo ; respect , and again in 1998 with intern & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; diva . & rdquo ; in 2018 , netta barzilai becam israel & rsquo ; s fourth eurovis winner with her rous rendit of & ldquo ; toy , & rdquo ; and in 2023 , pop star noa kirel came in third with her high - energi song , & ldquo ; unicorn . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; golan , the 20 - year - old isra singer who spent much of her childhood in russia , where she had a success sing career , ha shown great pois and determin in the face of the threat and hostil . & nbsp ; she told eurovis fun earlier thi week that she had complet trust in her secur detail and wa excit to compet . & ldquo ; thi is my dream come true . repres my countri and do someth big in front of the whole world ! & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; thi year it take on a differ and greater mean , to stand there on stage and show that we are here . we & rsquo ; ve been through & lsquo ; hurrican & rsquo ; to get to thi , i realli want to do it and i believ we & rsquo ; ll go to the final , but our particip is an achiev on it own , and it & rsquo ; s an honor . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; thi year & rsquo ; s show is complet differ from ani other year and the messag is that you trust me . the viewer chose me and they believ in me , which is crazi . i believ that everyth happen for the best , and i have strength . all the year of prepar and work on my skill have built me up and made me strong enough for thi moment . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; in the past , the glitzi product number , slick pop tune , outrag costum , and breathless present have made eurovis fun for it million of fan around the world but thi year , the theme of toler among nation will be test . & nbsp ; perhap in a contest where the perform rank second in the odd is a croatian band call babi lasagna , we should keep in mind that the it & rsquo ; s just entertain and that the real victori for israel thi year will be the safeti and well - be of golan and the entir isra deleg . & nbsp ;
