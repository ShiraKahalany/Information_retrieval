and sever restrict on plan and build in east jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; but oppenheim focus specif on the fate of four small commun in east jerusalem , where some 3 , 000 palestinian are & nbsp ; in danger of lose their home ; sheikh jarrah , batan al - hawa , bustan and walaja . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i am speak becaus these measur of palestinian displac have recent increas in scope and scale in an unpreced manner , & rdquo ; oppenheim said . & nbsp ; at issu are four legal battl ; two involv citi plan to build two nation park and the other involv landlord - tenant disput over land ownership and the legal of the home . & nbsp ; the most high - profil disput ha been the fate of four famili in the sheikh jarrah neighborhood , also known as the shimon hatzaddik neighborhood . & nbsp ; the four famili have appeal to the high court of justic to overrul two lower court rule , which determin that their home are own by the nahalat shimon compani that want to develop the larg palestinian neighborhood for jewish hous . & nbsp ; the area had been a jewish one prior to the 1948 war of independ when the resid fled . in the aftermath of the war , palestinian who fled sovereign israel , includ west jerusalem , move to that area . & nbsp ; some 28 famili were offer home there in exchang for relinquish their refuge statu . but the land , previous own by two jewish compani , wa not regist in their name . & nbsp ; the high court of justic is expect to hold a hear on the appeal on monday . it had initi delay the hear to give attorney - gener avichai mandelblit time to determin if the govern want to be a parti to the case and to render an option . & nbsp ; mandelblit told the court earlier thi month that he saw no reason for the state to interven , and threw the matter back to the court . & nbsp ; a sourc told the jerusalem post that prime minist naftali bennett would not order the evict of the sheikh jarrah famili . polic have the option to refus evict order that might caus a danger to secur . & nbsp ; hama ha claim that sheikh jarrah is one of the reason that it launch a salvo of rocket at jerusalem and other town in may , which spark an 11 - day gaza war . & nbsp ; bennett & rsquo ; s opposit to the demolit is like to delay the matter , possibl for a long time , but it could not ultim subvert the legal process should the high court rule against the famili . & nbsp ; it is believ that the fate of the petit by the four famili will determin the fate of the remain 24 famili in the neighborhood at risk of lose their home . & nbsp ; ambassador to the us and the un gilad erdan attack oppenheim when he address the council , charg that she had brought & ldquo ; hama & rsquo ; s lie about jerusalem to the secur council . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; it & rsquo ; s a move , he said , which & ldquo ; strengthen the terrorist organ and weaken the palestinian author , & rdquo ; and that it is an & ldquo ; absurd & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; danger & rdquo ; situat . & nbsp ; erdan warn that the & ldquo ; hama narr & rdquo ; put forward by oppenheim could be use to justifi terror attack against israel . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; today & rsquo ; s discuss might serv to increas hama & rsquo ; influenc in jerusalem and the palestinian arena , & rdquo ; erdan said . & nbsp ; he charg that ir amim had a & ldquo ; long histori of spread distort claim regard israel & rsquo ; s legitimaci and presenc in jerusalem , while ignor inconveni fact . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; erdan claim that more than & ldquo ; half of jerusalem & rsquo ; s arab resid would prefer isra citizenship to palestinian citizenship . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; far from be displac , erdan said , & ldquo ; jerusalem & rsquo ; s arab popul ha increas by over 400 % sinc jerusalem wa reunit in 1967 . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; an ir amim brief to the council , he said , is & ldquo ; as absurd as bring a leader of the yellow vest protest to give an & lsquo ; object & rsquo ; brief on the french govern & rsquo ; s econom polici . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; neither the ngo nor the secur council can undermin the & ldquo ; millennia - old connect between the jewish peopl and it etern capit of jerusalem . & rdquo ; he ad , & ldquo ; we will alway keep that promis . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; despit & ldquo ; fals claim to the contrari , we will never accept the delegitim of our legal , histor and nation right in jerusalem , by the secur council or ani other intern bodi , & rdquo ; erdan said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; success isra govern had frame these case as standard properti disput , & rdquo ; oppenheim explain to the unsc , but that in realiti they were & ldquo ; systemat campaign & rdquo ; aim at chang the demograph makeup of east jerusalem . thi is done by uproot palestinian famili and supplant them with jewish enclav within larger palestinian neighborhood , oppenheim said , ad that it & rsquo ; s a situat that creat friction and make norm commun neighborhood life difficult . & nbsp ; the situat is possibl becaus of the discriminatori legal system that allow jew to reclaim properti lost as the result of the 1948 war , but forbid palestinian from reclaim properti they lost in that war . & nbsp ; the & ldquo ; pretext for mani of the demolit are the absenc of build permit , which are nearli imposs to procur due to the absenc of proper zone plan that the isra author have fail to advanc , & rdquo ; oppenheim said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; mani of the famili face evict are palestinian refuge who lost home in 1948 , and who now stand to be displac for a second time , & rdquo ; she claim . & nbsp ; oppenheim also highlight the case of batan al - hawa in silwan , note that the court had ask mandelblit to provid a respons by august 29 . the request indic & ldquo ; a possibl understand that these case have far - reach polit and moral ramif and therefor requir & nbsp ; govern involv , & rdquo ; oppenheim said , ad that & ldquo ; the isra govern is now be compel to take an explicit posit on these evict proceed . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; that is whi intern pressur is so import at thi junctur , she said . & nbsp ;
