s son who live in america . lapid & rsquo ; s brother pass away from cancer after the book wa finish and the book is dedic to him . & ldquo ; we were veri close .... he knew me better than i know myself . he knew i would becom a writer befor i knew . & rdquo ; lapid may seem to be the ultim tel aviv insid , and at first , it is surpris that she wrote about charact who live on the margin of societi , but as you speak to her more , you begin to understand that she can identifi with these charact becaus she also grew up feel like an outsid . born in arad , a town where & ldquo ; you visit for a minut to get a cup of coffe and to go to the bathroom when the bu stop on the way to masada , & rdquo ; she move with her parent , who ran a judaica store , to the tel aviv area when she wa in her teen and struggl to fit in . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the distanc between a place like sderot or arad and tel aviv can be even longer than the distanc between tel aviv and new york , & rdquo ; she note . & nbsp ; work as a photojournalist in tel aviv after the armi , when she first met and then marri yair , she initi felt intimid by hi distinguish famili . yair lapid wa an actor and author at that time , and hi father , tommi lapid , wa a politician and a journalist , while hi mother , shulamit lapid , is an acclaim novelist . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i took literatur cours at the univers to keep up with them , so i wouldn & rsquo ; t seem like an idiot at their famili dinner , where they spoke about literatur and art all the time . & rdquo ; she turn to write after she suffer two miscarriag and wa put on bedrest when she wa pregnant with her son , lior , and need a way to express herself that didn & rsquo ; t involv run around tel aviv on a motorcycl with a camera . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; when lior wa born , i understood that no newspap is look for a photograph who ha to nurs everi four hour . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; anoth way in which lapid look at the world differ from how you might expect is that her daughter , yael , is on the autism spectrum . i have known lapid slightli for mani year becaus i also have a son on the spectrum the same age as her daughter , and she is the presid of shekel , an organ for peopl with special need in israel . & nbsp ; both of the lapid have been upfront about their struggl rais their daughter . at first , after yael & rsquo ; s diagnosi , lapid wa consum by tri to help her , to the exclus of everyth els . & ldquo ; i wa a wreck , i didn & rsquo ; t want to see anyon , i didn & rsquo ; t want to work , i just want to save her , i tri to do everyth for her .... there wa a veri dramat moment , where yair said to me , & lsquo ; you have other children who need you . & nbsp ; and you have me , and i need you . yaeli will be who she is for life , she & rsquo ; s not a project for a coupl of year , it & rsquo ; s not like she & rsquo ; ll go swim with dolphin and then everyth will be fine .... thi ha to go back to be a happi home . & rsquo ; & rdquo ; now , have a special - need daughter is an import part of who she is , but not her full ident . & ldquo ; i am connect to yael , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; i will alway need to be there for her . but i & rsquo ; m also a writer , i & rsquo ; m also lior & rsquo ; s mother and yair & rsquo ; s wife . i & rsquo ; m also a friend . & rdquo ; it wa interest for her to write the section about nina and irena & rsquo ; s relationship , becaus her relationship with her daughter is veri differ . & ldquo ; i have a daughter i can & rsquo ; t fight with the way irena and nina fight in the book . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; one aspect of the respons to her book in israel that ha pleas her is that , & ldquo ; peopl have said , it & rsquo ; s so isra . & rdquo ; now that it ha been publish in english , she isn & rsquo ; t afraid that reader in other countri will find it too isra and won & rsquo ; t be abl to relat to it . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s like read a book from abroad , a book like the kite runner , and it & rsquo ; s wonder that it give you an authent glimps into anoth world , a window into the life of someon complet differ . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; just befor head off to the ralli , she said that sinc octob 7 , she felt that the stori of the bereav mother in the novel wa even more relev . & ldquo ; everi time i see a pictur of a soldier who ha been kill , i think , there & rsquo ; s anoth mother like carmela now , who will miss him for 30 or 40 year , who won & rsquo ; t be abl to feel happi for 30 or 40 year . & nbsp ; they are soldier , but they are also our children .... now that the book is be publish in english , i think peopl who read it outsid of israel will have a greater understand of what it mean to be isra , of the price we pay for our life here , that & rsquo ; s veri meaning to me . & rdquo ;
