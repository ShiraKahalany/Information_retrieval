s relationship can be stir up by such a move . it wa creat by real - life marri coupl itamar rotschild , a musician , and dana idisi , the writer of such seri and movi as on the spectrum and here we are , who move to berlin with their daughter a coupl of year ago . they stay for about a year , then return to israel . & nbsp ; rotschild himself play yonah , the musician husband in the seri . shira naor portray talya , hi wife , a woman who ha publish a novel base on the stori of her mental ill brother , and idisi ha a brother on the autism spectrum , who wa part of the inspir for some of her recent work . & nbsp ; given all these similar , rotschild , speak from hi backyard in a recent interview , wasn & rsquo ; t exactli surpris when i ask how close the seri wa base on their actual life . & nbsp ; to what extent is the tv seri base on real life ? & ldquo ; let & rsquo ; s talk about the similar . we move to berlin becaus i want the experi of live abroad for a few year . for dana , it wa after the first season of on the spectrum and we flew there and live there for a year and a half , with our daughter . we have two daughter now but then we had onli one . for me it wa nice there , i found myself there , i felt good . & rdquo ; so mani young isra coupl spend at least a coupl of year abroad that it & rsquo ; s practic a rite of passag , but there haven & rsquo ; t been mani fiction portray of thi phenomenon . berlin , with it low cost of live and thrive art scene , ha becom a destin for thousand of young isra . rotschild and idisi thought of that when they live there , although rotschild emphas that despit the superfici parallel , it wa not their stori . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we knew the feel of be in berlin and feel foreign , but we creat the stori , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; it can be complic in so mani way to live in a foreign countri . there are lot of littl thing that you know how they are done at home , but in thi new place , everyth is differ , and you have a feel of be an outsid . & rdquo ; that feel put yonah and talya & rsquo ; s marriag under a strain : & ldquo ; there were all kind of problem befor in their marriag , but they were kind of hidden , but here , in berlin , everyth is amplifi . you are still you , but the new set bring out thing that were more under control befor . & rdquo ; when talya return to israel for a singl episod , she is confront by tough realiti of the life she left behind there , notabl that there are frequent missil attack from gaza dure her visit & ndash ; a disclaim note that the episod wa film befor octob 7 & ndash ; and that her brother and her parent are in denial about the sever of hi mental ill . & nbsp ; in a particularli harrow scene , he insist on return to work at hi job at the ramat gan safari after he ha been fire , and when talya tri to take him home , he jump out of the car near sever hippopotamus . & ldquo ; you see that so much is hard for her in israel , too , how complic it is for her there . & rdquo ; the relationship of isra to germani is also complic in all kind of way and berlin blue deal with that head - on . when yonah & rsquo ; s mother ( liora rivlin ) come for a visit , she can bare contain her anger at her son for choos to live in the countri that persecut her parent . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; lot of peopl are & lsquo ; anti [ german ] , & rsquo ; becaus of their parent , peopl don & rsquo ; t want to buy german good , wouldn & rsquo ; t want to buy a german car . i even know peopl my from my gener who won & rsquo ; t go to germani ... yonah & rsquo ; s mother ha a real issu that is connect to the trauma of what so mani jew went through there , and i think that we tri to show what & rsquo ; s behind it , and she isn & rsquo ; t just & lsquo ; anti , & rsquo ; but you see at the end , with her monologu in german , that she ha a real connect to the countri becaus of her parent , she isn & rsquo ; t just & lsquo ; anti . & rsquo ; & rdquo ; anoth way that the seri differ from hi own life , rotschild said , is that , & ldquo ; my music and the music in the seri are two differ thing . & rdquo ; rotschild is a guitarist and pianist who write and perform in a folk - rock style . he ha releas a number of album and is at work now on a new one , while yonah is an oboist who get a posit with a berlin orchestra . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i wa never in an orchestra . we thought about what would keep yonah in berlin , so that it make the conflict between him and talya , who want to go home , stronger , and we thought of have him be an obo player . the obo is an instrument that mayb one or two peopl in orchestra can play full - time in israel , but it & rsquo ; s hard to make a live at it here . but in europ , you can make a live at it , there are a lot of orchestra there . & rdquo ; rotschild had never play the obo and learn enough to look convinc handl the instrument on screen . & ldquo ; i had a veri good teacher , shani shachar , and she taught me how to play it and hold it and how to blow in it and how to clean it and how to get a sound from it . it & rsquo ; s a veri difficult instrument just to get a sound out of & ndash ; and i & rsquo ; m not talk about a beauti sound , just ani sound at all . & ldquo ; we did a lot of research to get into the world of classic musician , to check how it sound , how it feel , what it & rsquo ; s like , becaus it wasn & rsquo ; t a world we knew . it & rsquo ; s music that i like , but it isn & rsquo ; t music , or a world , that i realli know . & rdquo ; rotschild said that the director of the seri , ram nehari , who work with them for two year , & ldquo ; help to make the seri what is today , he direct it beauti and also work on the script . he had a big influenc on how well it turn out . & rdquo ; rotschild & rsquo ; s most import role prior to berlin blue wa also as a musician , in the seri , the echo of your voic . rotschild play a struggl artist who is the son of an arik einstein - like , all - time great perform , just as the rotschild charact & rsquo ; s own son becom a rise star . in an unusu achiev , the three lead actor , rotschild , shaul luria , and orr amrami brockman , share the award for best actor at the prestigi seri mania competit in franc . & nbsp ; but when ask whether he intend to continu act , rotschild said , & ldquo ; act is fun for me . it & rsquo ; s a kind of vacat , like take a vacat from myself . & rdquo ; despit hi success as an actor , he said , & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s not my profess . it seem to me that peopl who are profession actor have to take part that are not what they realli like , that are not that good , becaus that & rsquo ; s what they do . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i & rsquo ; m not there . i onli do thing i like . so if someon bring me a part that i can connect to , i & rsquo ; ll do it gladli , it & rsquo ; s fun when you feel that you can express yourself through it . but i & rsquo ; m not an actor . i & rsquo ; m a musician who sometim act . & ldquo ;
