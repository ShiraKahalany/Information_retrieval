[ and ] convey hi unwav support for israel & rsquo ; s secur and for israel & rsquo ; s legitim right to defend itself , while protect civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; secretari of state antoni blinken emphas that & ldquo ;

& nbsp ; blinken dispatch deputi assist secretari of state for israel and palestinian affair hadi amr to israel to help in the de - escal effort . & nbsp ; but all that happen on wednesday , three day after hama shot rocket into jerusalem and five day after a seriou uptick in violenc in jerusalem . these are short amount of time in the grand scheme of thing , but a long time in term of an escal . & nbsp ; the night befor that , at the veri same time that hama shot 150 rocket into tel aviv and central israel , send million of isra into bomb shelter , the biden administr & rsquo ; s spokespeopl sync up on a & ldquo ; both side & rdquo ; messag , despit one side be israel , a us alli and a democraci , and the other be hama , design by the us as a terrorist organ . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we condemn ongo rocket attack by hama and other terrorist group , includ against jerusalem . we also stand against extrem that ha inflict violenc on both commun , & rdquo ; white hous press secretari jen psaki said . & nbsp ; psaki soon move on to adopt the palestinian & rsquo ; narr that thi is about the sheikh jarrah / shimon hatzadik land disput & ndash ; the rule on which ha yet to be made , and whose resid have not actual been evict & ndash ; rather than take in the context of rise palestinian and arab violenc for the past month . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we believ palestinian and isra deserv equal measur of freedom , secur , digniti , and prosper , & rdquo ; psaki said . & ldquo ; and us offici , in recent week , have spoken candidli with isra offici about how evict of palestinian famili who have live for year , sometim decad , in their home and of demolit of these home work against our common interest in achiev a solut to the conflict . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; similarli , state depart spokesman ned price said minut earlier that & ldquo ; israel ha the right to defend itself and to respond to rocket attack . the palestinian peopl also have the right to safeti and secur , just as isra do . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we are also deepli concern about the report loss of life in gaza and israel , includ the death of children as well as mani innoc civilian injur . similarli , in jerusalem , where there reportedli have been hundr of palestinian injur , as well as isra polic , we call on all side to exercis restraint and to exercis calm . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; emerg from bomb shelter soon after those statement were made , the isra pay attent to psaki and price may have scratch their head as to whi israel & rsquo ; s greatest alli wa lectur them while they were rush their famili to safeti from rocket launch indiscrimin at civilian by a terrorist organ . & nbsp ; over the past week , the biden administr & rsquo ; s messag also focus on & ldquo ; de - escal . & rdquo ; they & rsquo ; re engag at all level , offici and spokespeopl said , to encourag isra and palestinian to de - escal . push by journalist in numer press brief to explain what that mean , what they & rsquo ; re actual do to bring the side away from the brink of war , the member and repres of the administr didn & rsquo ; t have much to say . & nbsp ; more than one senior isra offici said they & rsquo ; re satisfi with the us posit , point to statement by biden and blinken , as well as anoth by nation secur advisor jake sullivan , as & ldquo ; veri support , & rdquo ; as well as to american effort in the un to block the statement against israel . & nbsp ; in other word , the thing that they are do , on a practic level , are support of israel , and they are keep israel in the loop , as an alli would be expect to do . & nbsp ; isra offici also said they don & rsquo ; t feel that the us is pressur them to stop the oper in gaza , anoth clear sign of support . & nbsp ; but one of those isra offici also said that they & ldquo ; don & rsquo ; t have a clue . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; for four month , the biden administr made israel and the palestinian a low prioriti . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; they didn & rsquo ; t even think about gaza and hama , & rdquo ; the offici said . & ldquo ; when the palestinian elect came up , they didn & rsquo ; t know how to handl it . elect are a democrat valu , but hama could be elect , so they play the same game israel did . they didn & rsquo ; t oppos it publicli , but they sent messag they won & rsquo ; t be mad if it & rsquo ; s postpon .... and now hama is frustrat . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; on the one hand , the biden administr & ndash ; from blinken and sullivan to ambassador to the un linda thoma - greenfield to state depart offici & ndash ; realli is constantli in contact with isra , as it member have been say in their statement and brief . & nbsp ; on the other , the administr ha been fixat on jerusalem , the templ mount and sheikh jarrah in privat convers , accept the palestinian narr on the event . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; noth chang on the templ mount , except that hama is tri to present itself as defend the holi place , like arafat did in 2000 .... hama is frustrat that the palestinian author postpon the elect , thought it would strengthen them , and now they & rsquo ; re tri to build themselv up . the narr that jerusalem is the real problem is that of our oppon , & rdquo ; the isra offici said . & nbsp ; isra offici have found themselv be ask by member of the biden administr to stop a possibl suprem court rule to evict four palestinian famili from sheikh jarrah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i don & rsquo ; t even understand the argument , & rdquo ; the offici said . & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; re a democraci . we did the maximum to postpon the rule , but we don & rsquo ; t control the court . it & rsquo ; s the same court that evict settler . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; as for complaint about israel use stun grenad in the al - aksa mosqu , the offici point out that isra polic do not use gun at the holi site , but that peopl throw boulder at worship at the western wall and molotov cocktail at polic can not be given immun just becaus they use a mosqu as a launch pad . & nbsp ; an isra offici also express concern that the biden administr is more support in privat convers than in public statement . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; they use to say that israel doesn & rsquo ; t have foreign polici , onli domest polit . our feel is they & rsquo ; re constantli look at the left - wing extrem [ of the democrat parti ] that are against us and their pressur on them , & rdquo ; the offici said . & ldquo ; they & rsquo ; re put jerusalem in all their messag , even though it & rsquo ; s not realli connect , and then they talk about the need for restraint on both side . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; in a way , it seem like the administr wa caught off guard when the violenc spiral . & nbsp ; some have argu that the govern in jerusalem did not take the potenti for a conflagr serious enough , and israel will have to reckon with how it leadership vacuum left it unprepar . that may have color washington & rsquo ; s initi reaction . & nbsp ; but it didn & rsquo ; t have to be that way . uae - base news site the nation said that & ldquo ; washington began to pay attent to messag from arab govern onli last week , & rdquo ; after week of warn that a crisi wa brew in jerusalem . & nbsp ; shira efron , a senior research fellow at the institut for nation secur studi , also note the & ldquo ; bifurc messag & rdquo ; come from the biden administr , with messag that creat an equival between israel and it enemi , while also say & ldquo ; thi is a just fight , hama is a cruel terrorist organ and israel should fight back . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; read between the line , efron said she think the biden administr is & ldquo ; say israel ha got it ; they can handl it . i don & rsquo ; t see them activ work to de - escal . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; even amr & rsquo ; s visit may be larg symbol , becaus , as efron point out , the us doesn & rsquo ; t speak with hama . at most , amr can work with other mediat that do speak with hama , like turkey , qatar or egypt , and then relay messag to israel . & nbsp ; efron question whether the biden administr ha & ldquo ; a road map for de - escal . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; she note the biden administr ha de - emphas the isra - palestinian conflict : & ldquo ; they have bigger fish to fri , like china or climat chang , but the fact is that there is no assist secretari for near east affair , and there is no ambassador here . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; even the most compet and well - mean person & ndash ; and i think [ amr ] doe mean well & ndash ; can not do thi on hi own , & rdquo ; efron said . & ldquo ; he ha no staff , and i don & rsquo ; t think thi is a prioriti issu & rdquo ; for the biden administr . & nbsp ; if the latest event are a wake - up call for the administr , it still can not immedi solv it lack of prepar for a crisi in the region , efron said . it will take time for congress to confirm presidenti appoint . & nbsp ; the tone from washington would have been drastic differ if former presid donald trump were still in offic , but efron push back against the argument that there would be signific chang on the ground . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i don & rsquo ; t think thi ha much to do with the us approach . biden said they & rsquo ; re go to go back to a more tradit approach , but the fact is that not much ha chang . it hasn & rsquo ; t been transform ; it & rsquo ; s not like the palestinian are now welcom in washington with a plo mission , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; rather , efron argu , between ramadan , covid - 19 frustrat and the cancel of the palestinian elect , violenc against israel wa a & ldquo ; win - win & rdquo ; for hama , and the us reaction wa unlik to be a primari or even secondari consider . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; in 2009 , 2012 and 2014 , there were lengthi idf oper where we had a us that wa more activ in favor of the palestinian , and that didn & rsquo ; t help either , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; prof . eytan gilboa of bar - ilan univers , howev , argu that trump would have more full - throatedli condemn hama and islam jihad , and that would have had a palpabl impact . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; trump punish the palestinian . biden is tri to appeas them . so i think there would have been a differ stori if trump had been in the white hous , in term of oppos and condemn islam jihad and hama and support israel more , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; israel & rsquo ; s strategi , gilboa explain , is to punish hama and islam jihad sever , which will take time . us statement call to stop hostil weaken israel in pursuit of that strategi . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the american respons overal ha been timid , disappoint and irrelev ... say palestinian in gaza have the right for safeti and secur just as isra do ... as if thi is a confront between equal , & rdquo ; gilboa said . & ldquo ; both side are call on to reduc hostil & ndash ; israel and a terrorist organ design by the us . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s not evenhanded . it & rsquo ; s stupid . thi inadvert encourag hama and islam jihad to continu , & rdquo ; he ad . & nbsp ; similar to the isra offici , gilboa thought the biden administr ha read the situat wrong by focus on sheikh jarrah , which he call & ldquo ; irrelev . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the main point is hama and islam jihad & rsquo ; s goal of turn the west bank into gaza , of take it over .... if you don & rsquo ; t understand that , then your polici will miss the point , & rdquo ; he state . & ldquo ; the alumni of the obama administr seem to have learn noth . they & rsquo ; re present as veri experienc in foreign polici and nation secur ; that ha yet to be proven . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; by make the middl east a lower prioriti , biden will now learn that & ldquo ; if you run away from the middl east , the middl east run after you , & rdquo ; gilboa warn . & ldquo ; the us ha to take a posit .... it requir fresh think , but what i see are old habit . & rdquo ;
