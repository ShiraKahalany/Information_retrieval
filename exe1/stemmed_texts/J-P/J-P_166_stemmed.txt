we alway return to the same ineffect idea wrap in bombast statement that won & rsquo ; t lead to victori . the time ha come for new idea , & rdquo ; he said . the veteran politician , who is a fierc oppon of prime minist benjamin netanyahu , quit the govern thi week , after make a fail bid to be includ in the war cabinet . he had enter the govern togeth with the nation uniti parti at the start of the war to make a differ , but onc he understood that wa not possibl , he left , in a move that wa symbol of the polit turmoil , but which bare dent the coalit & rsquo ; s govern capac , bring it down from 76 to 72 seat . & ldquo ; we are stuck in everi direct . we are stuck in gaza . we are stuck on the lebanes border . we are stuck with the hostag , and we are stuck in the intern arena , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar explain , as he sat in hi offic in the knesset wear a suit and tie . he arriv late to the interview due to a vote in the plenum and left in the middl to particip in a second vote . he spoke in a week of high tension between israel and the unit state and amid increas intern pressur on israel to agre to a perman ceasefir , and if not , to at least paus hostil until the end of ramadan on april 9 . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s clear that the world want [ israel ] to end the war . it & rsquo ; s clear that the us administr , for all kind of reason , want the war to be over . so israel ha to stand [ alon ] against everyon . & ldquo ; but you can minim the disput with a better handl of the issu that caus us problem and with [ the initi of ] more proactiv polici , & rdquo ; he state . three error israel should correct in gazasa & rsquo ; ar focus on three error israel should correct in gaza , now that the war spark by hama & rsquo ; s invas of israel on octob 7 will soon hit the half - year mark . the first , he said , he put on the tabl alreadi in octob . he call for the & ldquo ; surrend and exil of the hama militari wing and the palestinian islam jihad from gaza to countri friendli to them : syria , turkey , qatar , and iran . & rdquo ; the hostag would be freed in conjunct , and the deal could also includ an isra agreement to releas some palestinian secur prison and terrorist , he said . the frame of the idea , he said , should be that it is israel & rsquo ; s ceasefir propos , rather than perpetu be in the posit of appear to object to a halt to the war . it also work as an answer to the intern object to israel & rsquo ; s pend militari oper in rafah to destroy the remain hama battalion . the & ldquo ; argument against it would be that hama won & rsquo ; t agre to it . that is probabl correct , & rdquo ; he said , & ldquo ; at least not at thi moment . & ldquo ; but at least we can tell the world and say , & lsquo ; we want to enter rafah , but we do not have to . & rsquo ; if thi [ hama surrend and exil plan ] happen , then we can end the war . you say you want a ceasefir . you want to end hama & rsquo ; s govern [ of gaza ] . well , here is a pragmat idea that also end the humanitarian suffer caus by the war , & rdquo ; he state . thi frame help put the onu on hama for the failur to achiev a ceasefir , he explain . & ldquo ; it give us more legitim with our friend , and then , if there are no other option , & rdquo ; israel can explain that it ha to finish the war becaus hama won & rsquo ; t agre to end it , sa & rsquo ; ar said . hi second issu dealt with the failur around the deliveri of humanitarian assist , for which israel did not provid option effect and quickli enough . sa & rsquo ; ar spoke amid a bitter disput between israel and the intern commun on the issu of humanitarian assist , with the unit nation and the european union accus israel of creat starvat condit in gaza . israel ha said that more than enough aid enter gaza , but that the un and intern organ have fail to properli distribut it . the armi should have seiz control of the situat from the start and creat a humanitarian administr to ensur the distribut of food and the provis of water and basic sanit , sa & rsquo ; ar said . the intern commun would still provid the aid and be involv , but the armi would have oversight to make sure that deliveri is success . & ldquo ; i know the armi doesn & rsquo ; t love thi , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar said , acknowledg that there are some risk with the plan , which could lead to increas friction between the idf and palestinian civilian in gaza . it & rsquo ; s a plan that also tackl some of the govern vacuum creat by the idf & rsquo ; s militari campaign against hama , which partial but not complet elimin the terrorist group & rsquo ; s forc rule of the enclav . until hama is destroy , there can & rsquo ; t be an altern govern in gaza , sa & rsquo ; ar said , ad that idf control of the distribut of basic servic , in partnership with intern organ , is the onli smart option that can prevent the terrorist group & rsquo ; s return . if the idf had taken charg of issu of food , water , medicin , and sanit , israel would have a better & ldquo ; stand in the intern commun , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar stress . hi third point , sa & rsquo ; ar said , is that the war ha to proceed at a quicker pace for the sake of israel & rsquo ; s economi , it intern stand , and the loom threat of an all - out war with hezbollah in the north . & ldquo ; we have alway known that we need to wage the war as quickli as possibl , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; it is hard for us to wage long - term war . & rdquo ; some thought that the intern commun would lose interest in the war as time went on , sa & rsquo ; ar explain , ad that he alway believ israel had a tight timelin for the war . & ldquo ; it wa clear from the start that thi idea wa mistaken . we can & rsquo ; t drag on the war forev , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; as long as you haven & rsquo ; t end the gaza war , you can & rsquo ; t deal with hezbollah , & rdquo ; he ad . hezbollah ha to withdraw from the border , he said , as he referenc diplomat effort to ensur that it compli with resolut 1701 , which set out the ceasefir term that end the second lebanon war in 2006 . onli then can the resid in commun along that border , who were evacu at the start of the gaza war when violenc broke out simultan with lebanon , return home . in the end , they will return home . & ldquo ; it ha to happen , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar stress , but that he hope israel will do it through diplomaci and not through a full - scale war . sa ' ar : a palestinian state is a danger to israelsa & rsquo ; ar , who began hi polit life in the likud in 2003 , and form hi own parti , initi call new hope , in 2020 , doe not disagre with all of netanyahu & rsquo ; s polici . he ha alway been oppos to the creation of a palestinian state , even more so now in the aftermath of octob 7 . & ldquo ; a palestinian state is a danger to israel , to it secur , and it is not a & lsquo ; mayb & rsquo ; danger ; it & rsquo ; s a clear danger . the creation of a palestinian state would allow them to continu their war to destroy israel from an improv posit . & rdquo ; it would & ldquo ; strengthen those palestinian forc who believ that war bring result . & rdquo ; israel ha to work to prevent palestinian statehood , he said . it can take a posit stanc on other issu regard the palestinian , but it can & rsquo ; t allow itself to go in thi direct . should the palestinian author be reform , such that it stop it monthli payment to terrorist jail by israel and the incit in it educ system , then it could be possibl to advanc in certain area , he said . sa & rsquo ; ar said he stand with netanyahu in oppos the return of the pa to gaza . he ha also support mani of the stanc netanyahu ha taken in the intern arena , includ in hi relationship with the unit state . & ldquo ; netanyahu is act to preserv israel & rsquo ; s intern interest in thi war , and in most of the situat when he fought with the us , i thought he wa right , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar explain . & ldquo ; histor , prime minist have been at odd with support us presid dure a war , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar said , as he recal the diplomat battl between former prime minist menachem begin and former us presid ronald reagan dure the first lebanon war . he point to the most recent battl between jerusalem and washington over the biden administr & rsquo ; s failur on monday to veto a un secur council resolut that call for a temporari paus to the war , without tie it to the releas of ani of the remain 134 hostag in gaza . befor the unsc vote , netanyahu threaten that if the us didn & rsquo ; t use it veto , he wouldn & rsquo ; t send a high - level deleg to washington for a schedul meet . after the vote , netanyahu held to hi word but ha sinc back down and is look to dispatch the deleg to the us next week . it wa a mistak for netanyahu to attempt to back the us into a corner , and it didn & rsquo ; t increas the chanc of a veto , sa & rsquo ; ar said . netanyahu should have kept hi object privat , but essenti he wa correct that the vote wa bad for israel , sa & rsquo ; ar said . the issu here is one of style , he explain . netanyahu ha & ldquo ; to know how to stand strong with friend , but to do it when it is essenti , and to do it in a respect way , & rdquo ; sa & rsquo ; ar said . he himself ha a long histori of stand on principl and wa one of the group of what wa known as the & ldquo ;
