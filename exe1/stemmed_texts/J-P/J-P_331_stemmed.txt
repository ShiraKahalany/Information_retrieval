the decis by the defens ministri to design six palestinian ngo as arm of the popular front for the liber of palestin terrorist organ quickli develop into an intern storm , with the us , the un and the eu rais object and question the valid of the move . & nbsp ; on monday , european union repres to the palestinian sven k & uuml ; hn von burgsdorff visit the six palestinian ngo defens minist benni gantz had target . on wednesday , repres of 25 isra nongovernment group paid a solidar visit to the al - haq offic in ramallah to voic their opposit to the design . two diverg narr emerg in the wake of the decis . in one realiti resid gantz , the defens ministri and pro - israel ngo , subscrib to the realiti that long - ignor terrorist activ cynic cloak in the guis of human right ha final been unmask . the other narr consid the six ngo to be human right organ and consid the design to be a draconian attack on palestinian civil societi . & nbsp ; on one side , you have prof . gerald m . steinberg , presid and founder of ngo monitor , who say : & ldquo ; there & rsquo ; s no justif for not consid or ignor or overlook the terrorist connect . these are not trivial . peopl & ndash ; isra & ndash ; have been kill . & rdquo ; on the other side , there & rsquo ; s samer sinijlawi , chairman of the jerusalem develop fund and fatah activist from jerusalem , who say : & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s just a blind war against all voic that are critic the occup and the abus of the human right of the palestinian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; which realiti is true ? is israel tri to suppress palestinian civil societi , or is it a legitim grievanc against terrorist organ ? after review the import of the ngo and their terror connect , where one fall seem to be a matter of prioriti . pflp affili the popular front for the liber of palestin is a marxist militari group recogn as a terrorist group by most of the western world . & nbsp ; israel claim that addam , al - haq , bisan center , defens for children intern & ndash ; palestin ( dci - p ) , union of agricultur work committe ( uawc ) and the union of palestinian women & rsquo ; s committe ( upwc ) are part of a pflp terrorist network that recruit , provid legitimaci to oper , and serv as a leadership wing for the pflp . they & rsquo ; ve been accus of funnel fund to terror through forgeri , launder , and the award of stipend to the famili of terrorist . & nbsp ; the govern hasn & rsquo ; t provid much inform to prove it alleg . but littl ha been done to disput them other than to note the group & rsquo ; status as human right ngo . thi leav everyon els to make sens of the diverg realiti . the ngo have reject the claim , but group like ngo monitor assert that there is enough open sourc document to prove that the onli thing under attack is terror . al - haq establish in 1979 and base in ramallah , al - haq is an award - win ngo with connect with dozen of intern human right bode , which describ itself as a human right ngo that & ldquo ; document violat of the individu and collect right of palestinian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; al - haq wa the first ngo that drew steinberg & rsquo ; s suspicion of pflp connect , & ldquo ; and in mani way is the most signific , of the one that were recent design as terrorist organ , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; al - haq is head by shawan jabarin , who sat in isra jail for a while , wa convict of be an activist member of the pflp , & rdquo ; said steinberg . & ldquo ; the court rule that he is a human right worker by day and a terrorist offici by night . & rdquo ; accord to ngo monitor , in 2018 , visa , mastercard , and american express shut down onlin donat to al - haq due to pflp tie . al - haq assert in a statement that the & ldquo ; baseless alleg & rdquo ; seek & ldquo ; to delegitim , oppress , silenc & rdquo ; palestinian ngo . it argu that the decis is not base on secur concern , but come due to & ldquo ; the open of an intern crimin court investig . & rdquo ; sinijlawi find it suspici that & ldquo ; these organ are lead the procedur in the icc , where gantz himself is the main target becaus he ha been the chief of staff in 2014 . & rdquo ; dci - p found in 1991 , dci - p is a palestinian child right organ that provid legal support to palestinian minor in the isra and militari court system . & ldquo ; we reject the recent design as anoth unjust action by isra author to crimin and elimin our law human right and child protect work , & rdquo ; said khale quzmar , gener director of defens for children intern & ndash ; palestin . & ldquo ; when year of delegitim and disinform campaign against us have fail to silenc our work , isra author now choos to escal repress tactic by label civil societi organ as terrorist . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; ve identifi five or six differ peopl at differ level of the organ that had been activ in the pflp , & rdquo ; said steinberg . & ldquo ; one in particular wa the coordin of dci - p & rsquo ; s commun mobil unit , hashem abu maria . & rdquo ; abu maria wa kill in a clash with the idf in 2014 and , accord to ngo monitor , wa call & ldquo ; a leader & rdquo ; by pflp . the design is not the first time that dci - p ha face charg of terror . citibank and arab bank plc reportedli ceas provid servic to dci - p over pflp link in 2018 . addam the addam prison support and human right associ , establish in 1991 , work and advoc for palestinian in isra prison , & ldquo ; offer free legal aid to polit prison , & rdquo ; and run social campaign . & ldquo ; they defend mostli pflp , the peopl who are accus in the isra legal process , & rdquo ; steinberg note . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the design repres an unpreced & amp ; omin attempt by the isra occupi author to silenc and crimin palestinian cso that challeng israel & rsquo ; s prolong militari occup , & rdquo ; addam tweet . accord to steinberg , addam & ldquo ; have a number of staff member who are connect to pflp . the founder , ( abdul - latif ghait ) wa a member and activist . the former vice chairman ... khalida jarrar ... she is defin as the head of the pflp oper in the west bank . & rdquo ; ngo monitor claim to have identifi at least five other pflp member in addam & rsquo ; s rank . bisan center the bisan center for research and develop special in socioeconom right and commun engag . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it should be note that bisan center for research and develop is an independ , nonpartisan center that is not affili with ani polit entiti , & rdquo ; bisan said in a statement on it facebook page . & ldquo ; thi announc [ of the terrorist design ] come after concert effort in the isra occup & rsquo ; s attempt in a defam campaign led by the isra ministri of foreign affair , & rdquo ; it continu . & ldquo ; the most recent [ bisan ] execut director ... wa sentenc for 12 month for recruit activist , & rdquo ; said steinberg . & nbsp ; ataraf rimawi , identifi by ngo monitor as bisan & rsquo ; s previou execut director , wa note in a court rule as a & ldquo ; pflp member & rdquo ; who & ldquo ; pose a secur threat . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; upwc the upwc is & ldquo ; a progress mass feminist organ that wa establish in 1980 , & rdquo ; accord to it websit . & ldquo ; and they have five individu that we & rsquo ; ve identifi on the payrol as pflp peopl , & rdquo ; said steinberg . & ldquo ; one of the founder of the pflp ... wa the presid of the upwc . so again , the connect there is pretti strong between [ the upwc and ] the pflp . & rdquo ; israel is not the first to identifi upwc as a pflp arm . in 2015 , fatah identifi the upwc as a pflp affili , as did usaid in 1993 . uawc among the largest agricultur institut in palestinian societi , uawc wa establish in 1986 to promot palestinian agricultur develop . & ldquo ; they run agricultur project in gaza and in the west bank , & rdquo ; said steinberg . & ldquo ; and that & rsquo ; s their excus . that & rsquo ; s the justif for the larg amount of fund . they get million from mani differ european countri . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; uawc reject and condemn israel & rsquo ; s unsubstanti alleg direct at uawc and the other ngo , which are polit motiv . it is tell that the isra govern refus to releas ani & lsquo ; evid & rsquo ; substanti these alleg , & rdquo ; the ngo told the jerusalem post . & ldquo ; we have identifi seven [ pflp - affili ] individu that have variou posit [ in uawc ] , & rdquo ; said steinberg . & ldquo ; a number of them have been sentenc in israel , and , of cours , samir arbid is stand trial ; he wa their account . & rdquo ; arbid and razak farraj , anoth uawc member , were arrest for their role in the 2019 terrorist attack that kill rina schnerb . & ldquo ; there are hundr of employe who have work and continu to work at uawc and thousand of volunt , & rdquo ; said a uawc repres . & ldquo ; uawc , like ani other organ , is not respons for ani individu action of ani former and current employe . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; we should not forget that arbid and farraj have been expos to horrifi tortur to pressur them to give confess , & rdquo ; said the repres . as with upwc , fatah and usaid document that uawc is a pflp affili . ngo monitor ha further note that due to arbid & rsquo ; s and farraj & rsquo ; s affili , the netherland suspend fund to the organ . & nbsp ; the uawc repres assert that the fund wa suspend onli becaus of & ldquo ; ngo monitor & rsquo ; s larg incit campaign against uawc . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; the repres dismiss the usaid design , say that the usaid & ldquo ; report [ in which uawc wa design a pflp affili ] wa publish befor the arriv of the palestinian author , and it is a report that talk about the begin of uawc and it work , which wa all voluntari . & rdquo ; a few bad egg ? the main evid for propon of the design doesn & rsquo ; t come from the govern , but from ngo investig show overlap of pflp member within civil societi . & nbsp ; sinijlawi argu that there are a few flaw in perceiv ngo as terrorist organ base on a few individu . the ngo could be unawar it ha terrorist in it rank . & ldquo ; i don & rsquo ; t think that , by law , ani ngo need to get a secur clearanc for ani person to get employ . if somebodi submit the cv and he & rsquo ; s qualifi for a job , he get it . & rdquo ; even if the ngo were awar , while some countri do not differenti between militari and polit wing , these ngo may have . & ldquo ; there could be a militari wing insid the popular front , but it doe not mean that everi student activist ... is involv in a certain type of violenc or militari action . & rdquo ; while some of the ngo may have had violent actor , & ldquo ; it doe not mean that thi organ is total involv into terror , & rdquo ; said sinijlawi . & ldquo ; to blame the whole peopl becaus of someon relat directli or indirectli to these ngo ... it & rsquo ; s a trick that anybodi will buy . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s not just that they & rsquo ; re member ... it & rsquo ; s high - level staff , & rdquo ; said steinberg , dismiss that it & rsquo ; s a few bad egg & ndash ; & ldquo ; in some case , the head of the organ , the peopl who control the money . & rdquo ; besid the pattern of ngo employe be pflp oper , steinberg note , pflp / ngo activist often hold multipl posit in differ ngo , includ in umbrella organ . & ldquo ; there & rsquo ; s a broader framework call pngo , palestinian ngo umbrella organ . these organ are all member of the pngo , and the head of the pngo gener ha been a pflp offici . & rdquo ; ngo or terror ? & ldquo ; what doe anybodi mean by palestinian & lsquo ; civil societi , & rsquo ; particularli when these organ are veri clearli part of a network which is not just terrorist , but it & rsquo ; s also part of the plo structur ? & rdquo ; steinberg ask . & ldquo ; what make these organ civil societi ? & rdquo ; the ngo & ldquo ; are veri import for palestinian , & rdquo ; said sinijlawi . the design is tantamount to & ldquo ; shut down the democrat dynam insid palestinian societi . & rdquo ; on it part , pflp ha not disput it connect to the ngo . & nbsp ; pflp polit bureau & rsquo ; s kay al - ghoul ha said that palestinian are & ldquo ; proud of the affili of ani of their son with ani nation faction that resist the occup , includ the & rdquo ; pflp . the neg reaction to the terror design show how import these organ are to palestinian and their alli . & nbsp ; year of terrorist activ in the midst of palestinian ngo show that when it come to terrorist in their rank , the prevail sentiment in the respons from the intern commun , palestinian activist , and intern bodi is that you need to break a few bad egg to make an omelet . the two realiti may not be so irreconcil . the ngo and the terrorist group are interconnect , and while palestinian civil societi may be under attack & ndash ; that may also be legitim . & bull ;
