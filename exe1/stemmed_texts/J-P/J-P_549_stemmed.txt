& nbsp ; palestinian author presid mahmoud abba told us and european union offici thi week that he is readi to return to the negoti tabl with israel under the umbrella of the quartet , which , in addit to the american and european , also consist of russia and the unit nation . & nbsp ; on wednesday , abba repeat hi readi to resum the stall peac process with israel dure a speech befor the arab parliament , the legisl bodi of the arab leagu . & nbsp ; abba & rsquo ; s talk about reviv the peac process came amid the war that erupt last week between israel and hama . abba & rsquo ; s remark came in the context of hi effort to show the american and european that he is as relev as ever and that they should look forward to work with him , especi regard ani futur peac process with israel . & nbsp ; abba , in other word , wa send a messag to everyon , includ the palestinian and arab , that he remain the one and onli address for ani arrang or agreement concern the palestinian and the conflict with israel . he felt the need to send thi messag as hi rival in hama were negoti with un , egyptian , qatari , turkish and other offici around the world way of reach a ceasefir with israel . & nbsp ; the 85 - year - old abba ha alway been known as someon who like to be the center of attent . he enjoy make a drama out of anyth that upset him . he also seem to relish the thought of keep everyon in suspens regard hi futur move , just as he did when he announc & ndash ; and later delay & ndash ; the palestinian parliamentari and presidenti elect , which were suppos to take place on may 22 and juli 31 , respect . & nbsp ; abba & rsquo ; s decis in late april to postpon the elect put the spotlight on him again , even though he receiv a lot of neg coverag in the arab and western media for use jerusalem as a pretext to call off the vote . but in thi case , abba seem to be go along with the famou quot : & ldquo ; i don & rsquo ; t care what the newspap say about me as long as they spell my name right . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; abba , howev , did not forese the consequ of hi decis to delay the elect and blame israel for hinder the vote . hi accus against israel , particularli surround the controversi over the particip of jerusalem & rsquo ; s arab resid in the palestinian elect , are seen by palestinian polit analyst as one of the factor that contribut to the erupt of violenc in the citi . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the presid did not expect that hi statement would add fuel to the fire , & rdquo ; said polit analyst ghassan abu omar . & ldquo ; wors , he did not expect the demonstr , which began in jerusalem and later spread to the west bank , to turn into pro - hama ralli . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; inde , hama wa success in it effort to take advantag of the violenc on the street of jerusalem to further bolster it stand among the palestinian public . hama leader in the gaza strip were rub their hand with glee as they watch thousand of palestinian in jerusalem and the west bank rais hama flag and chant : & ldquo ; we are all the men of [ hama militari wing command ] moham deif ! & rdquo ; & nbsp ; buoy by these scene , hama decid to take the risk of fire rocket at jerusalem dure the jerusalem day celebr as part of the gaza - base terrorist group & rsquo ; s effort to present itself as the & ldquo ; defend & rdquo ; of the citi and al - aqsa mosqu . appar , hama wa expect a limit respons from israel , one that would perhap lead to onli a few hour of fight . & nbsp ; the rocket that hama launch at jerusalem were direct not onli against israel , but against abba , too . the rocket were meant to show the palestinian public , as well as all arab and muslim , that while hama wa prepar to attack israel to & ldquo ; deter & rdquo ; it from evict arab famili from the east jerusalem neighborhood of sheikh jarrah , abba wa do noth to stop the isra & ldquo ; aggress . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the hama attack on israel made abba look veri bad , & rdquo ; remark a veteran palestinian journalist from nablu . & ldquo ; in the eye of the palestinian peopl , hama becam the hero , while abba wa continu to conduct secur coordin with israel , make him appear as a traitor . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; to avoid a damag loss of face , abba and hi rule fatah faction leader join call for a & ldquo ; day of rage & rdquo ; earlier thi week in protest of israel & rsquo ; s militari strike on the gaza strip . senior fatah leader such as mahmoud al - aloul were even sent to particip in demonstr against israel in some part of the west bank . fatah activist in ramallah and other palestinian citi tri to turn the protest into pro - abba ralli , but to no avail . & nbsp ; moreov , mask gunmen belong to fatah & rsquo ; s militari wing , al - aqsa martyr brigad , appear on the street of some palestinian citi in the west bank to issu threat against israel . thi move wa part of a desper effort by the fatah leadership to counter the numer appear of mask command and spokesmen of hama and palestinian islam jihad dure the past week . it wa fatah & rsquo ; s way of tell the palestinian public that the faction ha not abandon the arm struggl against israel . & nbsp ; in hi speech befor the arab parliament on wednesday , abba said that he wa still work to set a new date for the parliamentari and presidenti elect . he is also report to have relay the same messag to us envoy hadi amr and eu offici with whom he met dure the past week . & nbsp ; if true , thi messag prove that abba ha complet lost touch with realiti . ani elect that are held under the current circumst would be disastr for abba & rsquo ; s fatah , given hama & rsquo ; s rise popular among the palestinian in the aftermath of the latest round of fight with israel . & nbsp ; hama leader are alreadi claim & ldquo ; victori & rdquo ; for fire thousand of rocket and missil into israel and forc million of isra into bomb shelter . & nbsp ; they are also take credit for damag relat between jew and arab insid israel and allegedli forc israel to & ldquo ; scale down & rdquo ; it measur in jerusalem , includ the suspens of visit by jew to the templ mount , the remov of secur barrier at the old citi & rsquo ; s damascu gate and the postpon of a court decis to evict the arab famili from their home in sheikh jarrah . & nbsp ; these & ldquo ; achiev & rdquo ; will be ad to the fact that , as in previou round of hostil , the latest fight did not end hama & rsquo ; s rule over the gaza strip . hama may have suffer sever blow due to the loss of some of it senior militari command and the massiv destruct of it militari facil and terrorist infrastructur , but as long as it retain it control over the gaza strip , that & rsquo ; s seen by it leader and mani palestinian as a & ldquo ; victori . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; thi , in addit to the fact that hama onc again succeed in prove that despit the continu isra and egyptian blockad on the gaza strip , it ha manag to amass larg amount of rocket and missil . & nbsp ; needless to say , ani & ldquo ; victori & rdquo ; for hama is bad news for abba and fatah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; first , abba lost much credibl when he delay the elect , & rdquo ; explain palestinian academ marwan abu sbeih . & ldquo ; the gaza war drove the final nail in hi coffin . no one seem to take him serious , not even the arab leader . not a singl arab head of state call presid abba dure the war to talk about the situat . the onli peopl who were talk to him were the american and european , who still believ that he is relev . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; in the come day and week , abba is like to increas hi effort to return to center stage in order to show hi peopl and the rest of the world that he remain a major player in the palestinian arena . but the event of the past few month have shown that he ha even lost control over hi own fatah faction , which wa plan to run in the parliamentari elect on three separ list . the split in fatah and the fear of a hama elector victori are believ to be the main reason behind abba & rsquo ; s decis to delay the vote . & nbsp ; even if the us and the eu manag to reviv the peac process between the palestinian and israel , it & rsquo ; s hard to see how abba would be abl to return to the negoti tabl amid the fragment in fatah and the soar popular of hama . as a former fatah offici in ramallah comment thi week , & ldquo ; if the palestinian and arab no longer take thi man serious , whi should anyon els , includ the isra , american and european , take him serious ? & nbsp ; & ldquo ; thi man [ abba ] ha divid fatah , alien mani palestinian and consolid the divis between the west bank and gaza strip . the palestinian need new face , new leader . & rdquo ;
