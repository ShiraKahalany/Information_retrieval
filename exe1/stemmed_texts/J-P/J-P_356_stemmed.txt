& nbsp ; even with over 3 . 1 million twitter follow and a popular weekli televis show , british - american late - night televis comedian & nbsp ; john oliv doe not run the world . thank god . & nbsp ; becaus if he did , or if he even ran a small countri , israel would be face a humong challeng on the intern stage . & nbsp ; oliv deliv a viciou 10 - minut attack on israel on hi last week tonight show on sunday that wa as brutal unfair as it wa void of ani context . to sum up hi simplist argument : israel is hit hama much harder than hama is hit israel , more palestinian are die than jew , so israel is wrong , immor and guilti of war crime . & nbsp ; that & rsquo ; s the equival of say that becaus an estim 500 , 000 german civilian were kill in world war ii , as oppos to & ldquo ; onli & rdquo ; 67 , 000 british civilian , the nazi were right in that war , and britain wa wrong . & nbsp ; and oliv is not alon . other late - night comedian , such as trevor noah , have jump into the fray with their pearl of geopolit wisdom , as have variou entertain and celebr . & nbsp ; what all that doe , in a world where social media amplifi these voic well beyond what they deserv , is to creat a sens among mani isra that nobodi understand us , that everyon is against us . and while the oliv and noah are opinion influenc who have an overs impact on a younger demograph that often get it view of the world from those type of tv show , the world & rsquo ; s govern & ndash ; most importantli that of the us & ndash ; are not intern their drivel . at least not yet . & nbsp ; as the second full week of oper guardian of the wall is near complet , it would be a mistak to look at oliv & rsquo ; s and noah & rsquo ; s rant , or the tweet of radic progress us congresswomen rashida tlaib and ilhan omar , or listen to the anti - israel and often antisemit chant at protest around the globe , and see that as repres of where israel stand today in the world . & nbsp ; those rant are bad , those tweet are infuri , those chant are pernici , but when it come to the world & rsquo ; s reaction to israel & rsquo ; s campaign against hama & ndash ; mean the reaction of govern to israel & rsquo ; s action & ndash ; israel & rsquo ; s situat vi - a - vi the govern of the world is better thi time than it wa dure ani of the previou round of violenc with hama in gaza . & nbsp ; us presid joe biden and mani other leader around the world have given israel the & ldquo ; critic time we need & rdquo ; to carri out thi oper , former nation secur council head yaakov amidror said . & nbsp ; biden , who ha come under pressur from within hi own parti , primarili from the progress wing , to take a more activ role and demand an immedi ceasefir , said on wednesday dure a call with prime minist benjamin netanyahu that he support a ceasefir . twenti - four hour later , in anoth call with netanyahu , he said he & ldquo ; expect to see a signific de - escal today on the path to a ceasefir . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; thi wa after nine day of give unstint support to israel for it right to defend itself , and block three differ un secur council statement call for an immedi halt to the fight without mention hama or the rocket from gaza . & nbsp ; some have character biden & rsquo ; s call that he expect a de - escal as us pressur , other that it portend an immin crisi in tie between the two leader and the two countri . amidror caution against hyperbol . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i don & rsquo ; t think there is pressur , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; i think that what the american are say is that they want to see a ceasefir . but that is not pressur . they understand the need for israel to complet the oper , they understand we are talk about a terrorist organ that cross all redlin , open fire on isra citi . therefor the administr gave us time . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i make no pretens of understand how america work , & rdquo ; said amidror , a fellow at the jerusalem institut for strategi and secur . & ldquo ; i look at what they have done , and what they have done up until now is to give us the time we need . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; amidror said he wa not surpris by thi , sinc the leadership in the democrat parti & ndash ; & ldquo ; contrari to the percept here & rdquo ; & ndash ; still maintain & ldquo ; check and balanc over the radic progress element within the parti that sometim contain antisemit element . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; what is iron about biden & rsquo ; s support is that it ha disappoint some on the right , becaus it disrupt their narr that biden is a reincarn of barack obama who will squeez israel at the first opportun , and at the same time ha also disappoint some on the left who would like to see much less support for israel . & nbsp ; there are also isra domest agenda at work among those who want to character biden & rsquo ; s comment as & ldquo ; pressur . & rdquo ; those polit oppos to netanyahu would like to cast him now in the role as someon on a collis cours with biden and hi administr , while the prime minist & rsquo ; s support are keen on paint a pictur of perfect harmoni between the two men who have known each other for nearli 40 year . & nbsp ; but there are object standard against which to judg pressur to withdraw . here & rsquo ; s one : in april 2002 , just nine day into israel & rsquo ; s oper protect shield aim at crush the terrorist infrastructur in the west bank that wa respons for hundr of death dure the second intifada , presid georg w . bush call on prime minist ariel sharon to withdraw idf troop immedi from the palestinian citi they had move into . & nbsp ; at a press confer in crawford , texa , bush said , & ldquo ; my word to israel are the same today as they were a coupl of day ago : withdraw without delay . & rdquo ; he ad that he expect israel to & ldquo ; heed my advic . & rdquo ; sharon didn & rsquo ; t , the militari campaign went on for anoth month , and us - israel tie surviv . & nbsp ; biden & rsquo ; s expect of de - escal and support for a ceasefir doe not come near that bush standard of rhetor pressur . & nbsp ; aviv shiron , a recent retir diplomat who previous serv stint as israel & rsquo ; s ambassador to the netherland , austria and switzerland , said that in comparison with other round of violenc in gaza in the past , & ldquo ; the intern pressur thi time is less signific and massiv . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we have seen the new us presid give full support to israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and did not demand an immedi ceasefir . now he is call for a ceasefir , but we are 11 day into the oper & ndash ; that is veri signific . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; also insid the european union , which is alway more critic , there were more countri thi time that support israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and did not demand a ceasefir . & rdquo ; he also point out that isra flag were flown atop govern build in germani , austria , the czech republ and slovenia as a sign of solidar . & nbsp ; shiron attribut thi primarili to the fewer civilian casualti in gaza than in the past . & ldquo ; the collater damag is less , and we are see fewer pictur of dead and injur and children , even though there are alway civilian casualti . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the number of casualti in gaza is less becaus the idf and the air forc have learn lesson from the past , and as a result pressur come from variou govern is less , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; shiron maintain that anti - israel protest on the street of london , pari , berlin and washington alway accompani thi type of conflict , and that there is littl differ in them thi time around . as they continu , there will be more pressur on variou govern to speak out and take a stand , but & ldquo ; all in all thing are better than in previou time . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; hama took advantag of exist tension in jerusalem as it pretens for launch attack , and start the current campaign by fire at jerusalem & ndash ; an act that succeed in both play on and build up passion of muslim around the world , includ among isra - arab , someth hama certainli deem a & ldquo ; success . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; at the same time , howev , shiron said that fire on jerusalem hurt hama in capit around the world . & ldquo ; when you fire on jerusalem , as oppos to sderot , it is perceiv differ in the world . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; amidror , who agre with shiron that europ ha larg given more support for israel than in the past and allow it to carri out it oper accord to it own timelin , said there were three main reason for thi degre of understand among mani world govern . & nbsp ; first , he said , wa isra restraint over incid from gaza in the week befor hama fire rocket toward jerusalem on may 10 . second , is that it is clear to the govern around the world who start the conflagr . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; and the third thing is that they are shoot at civilian target , while everyon understand we are shoot at militari one , & rdquo ; amidror said . & ldquo ; sometim we err and civilian are kill , but our intent & ndash ; and the direct of our fire & ndash ; is toward militari target , while they are shoot at civilian from among civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; amidror said that even those critic of recent isra action in jerusalem , such as effort to evict four famili from sheikh jarrah and polic activ dure ramadan at the damascu gate , understand that there are huge gap between the claim of isra error in thi matter and the respons . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; there is disproportion between the claim against us , and the reaction . for the sake of argument , let & rsquo ; s say that they were right , that our behavior could have been gentler in jerusalem . doe that justifi rocket on jerusalem and tel aviv ? there is tremend disproportion . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; but that disproportion & ldquo ; play into our hand , & rdquo ; amidror said , as & ldquo ; reason peopl understand that a terrorist organ took advantag of the situat to fire on civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; while amidror maintain that the reaction of much of the world overal ha not been overli bad , includ russia , china is an except . there the oversea channel of state broadcast cctv air a report shot - full with antisemit trope . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; .... some peopl believ that us pro - isra polici is traceabl to the influenc of wealthi jew in the us and the jewish lobbi on us foreign polici - maker , & rdquo ; said host zheng junfeng , ask hi audienc whether us support for israel wa truli base on share valu . & ldquo ; jew domin financ and internet sector . so do they have the power lobbi some say ? possibl . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; amidror took umbrag . & ldquo ; there is a big differ between be for a ceasefir and antisemit claim , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; as someon who veri much valu the relationship with china , it pain me to see antisemit claim in china compet with the antisemit argument of [ turkish presid recep tayyip ] erdogan . thi is beneath china . & rdquo ;
