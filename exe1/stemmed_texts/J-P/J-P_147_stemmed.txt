& lsquo ; i want to express the veri bizarr and extrem realiti of these trip , what it & rsquo ; s realli like to be there at that age , & rdquo ; said asaf saban , the writer / director of deleg , a new featur film that open on thursday and look at teen on a high - school class trip to poland , where they visit death camp & ndash ; a quintessenti isra rite of passag . saban knew that make a dramat film about the realiti of such trip , rather than the ideal , would not be easi . but he ha creat a thought , compel film , well - written and well act , that illumin the complex of one of these trip in the & rsquo ; 90 . & nbsp ; it neither sentiment the charact & rsquo ; emot nor condemn the teen for just be teen . he did that through creat sever quirki , relat charact , among them frisch ( yoav bavli , ) a sensit guy , who ha a crush on nitzan ( naomi harari , ) an ostens relax , confid girl . but nitzan is more troubl than she seem , and the trip bring out strang emot in her , which caus her to take an action on one of the concentr camp tour that is veri human but obvious wrong . ido ( leib levin ) is a brash extrovert focus on usual teen concern like girl and drink , and doesn & rsquo ; t suddenli becom an altruist in poland . deleg spotlight how there is some manipul built into these trip , as the teen have group discuss in which they are encourag to show emot , the more intens the better . the difficulti creat by thi are illustr by the charact of yosef ( ezra dagan , in a heartrend perform , ) and frisch & rsquo ; s grandfath . he is a survivor who accompani the class . & nbsp ; as the grandfath begin tell hi person stori to the group , he speak charmingli and engagingli about hi life and experi as a child befor hi famili wa deport . but it & rsquo ; s rambl , contain a great deal of person detail , and isn & rsquo ; t what the group leader ( alma dishi ) want to hear . she is portray not as a villain but as a cog in a system design to elicit a particular set of reaction : tear at the horror and pride in the state of israel . & nbsp ; in one of the film & rsquo ; s most move scene , she take the survivor asid and he admit that he know he hasn & rsquo ; t been say what the student need to hear . & ldquo ; i get it . you want me to get to the action more quickli , & rdquo ; he say . as the film goe on , he is overwhelm by emot and can & rsquo ; t & ldquo ; get to the action . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; prize winningit ' s not surpris that saban & rsquo ; s complex , multi - layer script won the anat pirchi best screenplay award at the jerusalem film festiv last year , or that hi cast took the best ensembl award there . and it & rsquo ; s particularli hearten that the film receiv recognit in poland , where it won a special award at the warsaw film festiv . & nbsp ; the film wa inspir by saban & rsquo ; s own experi on such a trip year ago . & ldquo ; it wa the first time i wa abroad without my parent . that & rsquo ; s an import detail , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; there is someth festiv about be abroad . i rememb the excit and my wish , and i think thi is characterist of young peopl that age , regardless , whether they are isra or not , whether it is a holocaust trip or not , to experi someth great . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the realiti for me is that i rememb the trip in fragment , and i rememb feel that i didn & rsquo ; t respond in the way i wa meant to . i don & rsquo ; t rememb much about the histor site . i have mani meaningless memori of small moment . i think thi is what character us as human be , the gap between the expect and what we realli take away from the experi . & rdquo ; he said he wasn & rsquo ; t interest in debat whether the trip are worthwhil or question the motiv of the student who take them . & ldquo ; befor you place a lot of polit and sociolog interpret on them , the realiti of these trip is that they are a veri extrem and weird experi . & ldquo ; as weird as they are , these trip are the ultim norm experi for isra teen . it & rsquo ; s a disson that is fascin for me , becaus it say a lot . i want to look at it and give more weight to the subtext . peopl go into thi territori with a lot of expect and preconceiv opinion that are all express with an exclam point . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; for me , it wa veri import to speak quietli , with sensit and to direct the viewer & rsquo ; s glanc to the nuanc and ask question , and not necessarili give answer . i want to replac the exclam point with question mark . & rdquo ; he alway kept in mind the import of the realiti of the holocaust and to treat it with respect , not to exploit it for drama . & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s someth that i as a filmmak am veri sensit to , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s an ethic question . how do you creat a drama in such place [ where the holocaust took place ] ? you can manipul the viewer emot , by use imageri and use the holocaust as a drama in the background to elicit emot , in way that are too easi . and the dilemma i felt as a filmmak mirror what the student go through there . & rdquo ; saban made a point of creat & ldquo ; veri typic charact , who are deal with small , ordinari problem . my challeng wa to shift the attent to the detail and dynam among these charact in the present , when in the background you have the greatest drama , not just in jewish histori , but in the histori of human . & rdquo ; speak about the charact of the grandfath who is not encourag to express hi stori fulli and in depth , he said , & ldquo ; i think he want to succeed . he want to perform hi role in the way that is expect of him . he ha the will to do it , but not the abil . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; saban said that the toughest task for him wa to put asid hi perspect as an adult and recaptur the feel of what it wa like to be in poland and at the death camp at age 17 . & nbsp ; but with yosef , he allow himself to look at the experi with the eye of a more matur person . & ldquo ; there is a similar between how i want to tell the stori of the student in the film and how yosef want to tell hi stori . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; when a sheepish yosef admit to the teacher that he know he isn & rsquo ; t get to & ldquo ; the action & rdquo ; & ndash ; the horror & ndash ; quickli enough and will tri to do better , that sentenc express someth that saban wa also grappl with . & ldquo ; i & rsquo ; m also say to the viewer , you come to thi with expect , but mayb you won & rsquo ; t get the action in the place you expect , at the volum that you & rsquo ; re expect to hear . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; with the charact of yosef , he is the storytel , but he isn & rsquo ; t the storytel you expect . the fact that he fail and can & rsquo ; t finish hi task in the way that is expect of him & ndash ; that is the deepest and truest proof of hi authent , of the authent of hi experi and hi feel . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i think that & rsquo ; s life . peopl like ann frank and etti hillesum succeed in express their human in the context of their person experi , and that & rsquo ; s what creat the drama of their stori . that & rsquo ; s whi you rememb them . & rdquo ;
