at least partial : until june 5 , 31 peopl in the arab commun were murder in israel , includ four women , compar to 50 murder in the first half of 2021 ( up to may 27 to be exact ) . in total , accord to polic data , sinc the begin of the year , 42 peopl have been murder throughout the countri , of which , as mention , 31 were from arab societi . so far the polic have solv onli 12 murder case in the arab sector thi year . the polic attribut thi decreas in the number of murder in the sector to the oper . murder on the risedespit the effort polic have put forward , some remain skeptic about the actual effect they have , as murder case in arab societi continu to rise , hit 55 murder up until juli , accord to data from independ ngo . while polic action are at the forefront of the oper , it is much larger in scope when look at from a broader len . effort of the financ ministri and incom tax offici , for exampl , set out to combat money launder and illeg loan , which in turn entangl mani civilian . & ldquo ; mani arab town in the north don & rsquo ; t even have a bank or ani other mean of legal handl financi affair . left out of option , they turn to organ crimin syndic , & rdquo ; ola najami - yousef & ldquo ; mani arab town in the north don & rsquo ; t even have a bank or ani other mean of legal handl financi affair . left out of option , they turn to organ crimin syndic , & rdquo ; ola najami - yousef , vice presid of the abraham initi ngo , which track crime in arab commun , told the magazin in an interview . the issu , she explain , is much larger than a simpl lack of polic . the arab commun have long face neglect from all government offic , from financ to educ . resid are often left to their own devic , someth that leav a larg vacuum for crimin to fill . arab were view as a secur threat themselvesbefor safe rout wa initi , arab were view as a & ldquo ; secur threat themselv . even though a lot of these issu were well known to the govern , noth wa done , until now . & ldquo ; the way arab societi is view and discuss ha chang ; we & rsquo ; re no longer social pariah , and a wide rang of effort is now be undertaken to give arab commun what they right deserv as isra citizen , & rdquo ; she said . the problem with crime in the commun often stem from thi larger perspect that paint arab as a collect threat . even if a plain citizen got entangl with crimin element on account of a lack of servic , he had no one to turn to when thing turn sour , a situat that not onli left an open for crime on it own but also sever hurt the commun & rsquo ; trust in the polic , further increas the reign of crimin . in town like nazareth , where najami - yousef live , you could hardli notic polic presenc , and town like jisr e - zarka didn & rsquo ; t even have a function polic station , even though the build for it exist . now , polic are make effort to increas their presenc , understand that the lack of trust from local sever impact how well they could combat crime effect . the chang is certainli be felt . jasser & rsquo ; s polic station , which had been vacant until now , is fulli staf , and town like rahat and nazareth are see more patrol car on the street . najami - yousef , a resid of nazareth herself , even state that & ldquo ; you could even hear less gunfir in nazareth these day . & rdquo ; to further the bond with the commun , the abraham initi ha organ meet between teen and polic offic from local station . the chang , najami - yousef said , is slowli start to take effect . but when look at the still high murder rate which claim the life of 11 arab in the last month , one could question the effect of thi chang . & ldquo ; these thing take time , & rdquo ; najami - yousef explain . & ldquo ; it may take up to five year until we would see a practic chang in murder . & rdquo ; najami - yousef even theoriz that the latest chain of murder could be a direct respons to polic effort , with crimin organ feel the pressur and , in turn , attempt to clean hous . polic offici claim , on the other hand , that the oper ha attain signific achiev , and that the decreas in the number of murder is felt & ldquo ; everywher & rdquo ; in the arab sector . one of the reason for thi , accord to them , is that budget are now be divert to combat violenc in the sector , make it possibl to strengthen the forc station in the arab commun and also recruit arab directli to the polic . & ldquo ; in the last five year , 800 muslim have been recruit to the israel polic . today the polic can react quickli when case of violenc occur , & rdquo ; a polic offici said . & ldquo ; along with the continu of enforc and it deepen , in order to deal with the phenomenon and complet deter it , a multisystem treatment and a deep - root chang beyond polic enforc are need , & rdquo ; said ch .- supt . hirsch . & ldquo ; the israel polic will continu the determin fight in arab societi and everywher els , all in order to maintain public peac and secur . & rdquo ; â–
