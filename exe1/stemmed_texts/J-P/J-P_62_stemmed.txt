the polit is get out of control , and the question is whether it put the fate of the hostag and the object of defeat hama at risk . & nbsp ; white hous offici insist that they were taken aback by prime minist benjamin netanyahu & rsquo ; s announc that he wa call off a trip to washington by a deleg head by nation secur advis tzachi hanegbi and strateg affair minist ron dermer , after the us refus to thwart a un secur council resolut which call for an immedi ceasefir in gaza . the biden administr is familiar with the player in netanyahu & rsquo ; s circl . hanegbi and dermer , the latter in particular , are the prime minist & rsquo ; s peopl . us offici acknowledg that with thi decis to call off the trip , netanyahu wa & ldquo ; put hi foot down , & rdquo ; feel increas heat person from the administr over how he is run israel & rsquo ; s affair . & ldquo ; minist benni gantz wa here earlier thi month , defens minist yoav gallant is here now , [ and ] the defens establish are in constant contact , & rdquo ; a white hous aid argu . & ldquo ; call off the hanegbi - dermer deleg is polit window dress by the prime minist . & rdquo ; in respons to the question of whether the administr wa also act polit & ndash ; by support israel but look over it shoulder amid the presid & rsquo ; s re - elect campaign to make sure it didn & rsquo ; t alien it elector too much & ndash ; a white hous aid insist : & ldquo ; israel ha no better friend than the biden administr , in gener & ndash ; and regard gaza , in particular . & rdquo ; on the one hand , the aid seem to be charg that netanyahu wa not suffici appreci the administr & rsquo ; s obstacl cours in navig it polici regard gaza , and that call off the visit to washington by hi deleg onli exacerb the public impress & ldquo ; that the two countri are not on the same side . & rdquo ; on the other hand , the aid reiter that & ldquo ; on the ground , our cooper is not affect . & rdquo ; biden on netanyahu ' s govern & nbsp ; in a recent msnbc interview , presid joe biden charg that netanyahu wa do more harm than good ; he ha also publicli question israel & rsquo ; s plan for a rafah oper . howev , a white hous aid insist that the presid & rsquo ; s endgam remain & ldquo ; the defeat of hama . & rdquo ; yet , regard hanegbi and dermer stay home , instead of visit washington at least right now , administr offici seem fine with hold high - profil contact in the us capit with high - level isra offici who themselv have tens relat with netanyahu . the presid and hi peopl are awar of domest issu in israel , includ the resist by gallant and gantz to netanyahu & rsquo ; s move on the matter of haredi ( ultra - orthodox ) enlist in the idf . within the biden administr , there isn & rsquo ; t total smooth sail either . offici have acknowledg that vice presid kamala harri ha been the & ldquo ; weak link & rdquo ; in support for the isra campaign in gaza . yet , said one offici , & ldquo ; she is toe the line and in principl support what the isra mission is all about , & rdquo ; even if her pronounc at time & ldquo ; seem more blunt about what israel is do wrong . & rdquo ; biden ha stronger support for hi gaza polici , say aid , from secretari of state antoni blinken , defens secretari lloyd austin , and nation secur advisor jake sullivan . some aid seem to hint that have harri play & ldquo ; bad cop & rdquo ; with some of her declar on israel allow biden to hope he can placat those who say they would vote for him in novemb , but are threaten not to do so over what some even call hi support for & ldquo ; genocid . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; listen , the [ un ] secur council call for a ceasefir , but it also call for a releas of the hostag , & rdquo ; argu a biden aid . & ldquo ; we have not abandon israel , [ and ] we have not abandon the isra mission in gaza . we have also not abandon the need for humanitarian aid and work toward the overal well - be of palestinian in gaza . cooper is key - but difficult in attain & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the question is what is the best way to achiev all these goal ; it is challeng , & rdquo ; the aid said . & ldquo ; we want to work with the isra . we want to work with them on how to achiev victori over hama in gener , and how best to achiev the aim of a rafah oper in particular , but not in a way & ndash ; as both the presid and vice presid have said & ndash ; that would lead to a civilian bloodbath . and ye , we want the return of the hostag . & rdquo ; biden & rsquo ; s re - elect campaign advis continu to watch the gaza polici close . the presid is said to be feel the heat over warn he is receiv that he ha a veri thin tightrop to walk on : promot hi polici but not risk defeat in novemb . & ldquo ; gaza is not the onli reason for concern , & rdquo ; conced a biden polit advis , & ldquo ; but it & rsquo ; s a big reason . & rdquo ; netanyahu & rsquo ; s announc & ndash ; call off the visit by the hanegbi - dermer deleg to washington to discuss rafah polici and how to releas the hostag & ndash ; came as the prime minist wa battl for hi polit life , warn coalit naysay to the propos regard haredi militari recruit that if an agreement is not reach , the govern would fall . so appar , the us and isra landscap both current abound with polit window dress by the two leader , biden and netanyahu . such behavior is not rare in the polit world , but right now , if these maneuv by the presid and prime minist do in fact get out of control , the ramif could be extrem danger and deadli . the writer is op - ed editor of the jerusalem post .
