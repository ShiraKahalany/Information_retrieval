& nbsp ; fakhri abu diab live in east jerusalem , but everyth he know about israel & rsquo ; s capit is differ from the one that hi jewish neighbor love . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; anyon who come to east jerusalem know that it is not the same citi and not the same languag , & rdquo ; said abu diab , who is a spokesman for the silwan neighborhood . & nbsp ; the barrier that onc divid jerusalem prior to 1967 ha long sinc been torn down . fifti - four year have pass sinc israel creat a unit capit when it wrest control of the eastern part of the citi from jordan dure the six day war . & nbsp ; next week , as israel celebr jerusalem day to mark that victori , few will rememb where that barrier realli stood , but the scar of the divis still reson in the citi . & nbsp ; at issu are not just the cultur and linguist differ between the palestinian popul that larg live in east jerusalem and make up 39 % of the municip & rsquo ; s 900 , 000 peopl . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; geopolit play a role . most of the intern commun support a divid jerusalem , where the eastern part of the citi would be the capit of a futur palestinian state . an addit complic factor is the fact that most of the palestinian have jerusalem resid but lack isra citizenship . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; but over time , for mani jewish isra , the differ have almost begun to appear cosmet . they walk around a citi that easili look unit and whose redivis seem unrealist and unfeas . & nbsp ; for jerusalem & rsquo ; s deputi mayor fleur hassan - nahoum the citi & rsquo ; s uniti is obviou . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; jerusalem is a citi compris of commun . that is the essenc of jerusalem . it is a citi of commun , but it is a unit citi . what make it unit ? you have one municip author take care of all of it resid , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; that author is in charg of transport , health , educ and public space , she ad . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; that municip author , especi in the last few year , ha made it a point of be an inclus author , where everyon ha a voic , and where everyon can approach the mayor and the deputi mayor and can advoc for their commun and receiv resourc for that commun , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; on a public level , what we have seen in the last five to 10 year is a citi that is more integr than it ha ever been . ten year ago , you never had a young arab student work in fox , & rdquo ; hassan - nahoum said , ad that mani of the shop throughout the citi are staf by arab resid . & nbsp ; today , public space is share by jewish and arab resid of the citi , includ in coffe shop and gym . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; whether peopl admit it or not , whether the detractor can still point finger at the divid citi & ndash ; in essenc , in the day - to - day experi for most peopl , & rdquo ; the citi is integr physic , logist and relat , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; i don & rsquo ; t think our work is finish , & rdquo ; she said , ad that more need to be done on issu of equiti and job placement , particularli in the hi - tech industri , but that is true with respect to ani commun that ha been margin , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; for mani year the govern of israel , whether left or right , did not know what to do with the issu of east jerusalem , hassan - nahoum said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the left think one day it will be the capit of a palestinian state , and the right wing is concern with other issu , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; partial , she said , the problem lay with the palestinian themselv . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we had a hostil commun , with littl leadership , manipul by the palestinian leadership in ramallah . it wa difficult . i am not say it wa all their fault , but i believ we are in a differ place now . the arab in east jerusalem are realiz that they are get zero , noth , from the palestinian leadership , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; she credit jerusalem mayor mosh lion and former jerusalem affair minist ze & rsquo ; ev elkin , now a new hope mk , for make stride in close the equiti gap between jewish and arab resid of the citi , includ the develop of partnership with the local arab leadership . & nbsp ; when riot broke out a few week ago , lion , who is sabbath observ , walk on saturday to meet with commun leader to seek a way to calm the situat , she said . & nbsp ; the citi & rsquo ; s uniti wa most clearli appar , she said , dure the covid - 19 pandem , when everyon band togeth to fight a common enemi . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it wa beauti . it wa a difficult time , but we came togeth as a citi and that is the measur of how far we have come , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the dna of jerusalem is one of divers , & rdquo ; she said , as she explain that king david chose thi space to build thi citi 3 , 000 year ago becaus it did not belong to ani one tribe and thu it could be a place where everyon could gather togeth . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; our dna is one of converg , of east and west , of old and new , of past and futur and heaven and earth . we will solv all of the conflict in our countri and in our region from jerusalem , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; the execut director of the left - wing ngo ir amim , yudith oppenheim , said that , factual speak , israel annex east jerusalem in 1967 and sinc then it ha been manag by one municip . & nbsp ; on the surfac , & ldquo ; you can look at jerusalem and say here is an urban space in which peopl can move from one place to anoth , so mayb thi is a unit citi , & rdquo ; oppenheim said . & nbsp ; but & ldquo ; when you look deeper into the situat , you see that the citi is actual divid in mani aspect , and each one portray a pictur of two veri unequ societi , in which one control the other , & rdquo ; oppenheim ad . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; one side ha all the resourc and is veri dedic to express it hegemoni , & rdquo ; and the other side lack those resourc , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; the issu , she said , start with the fact that most of the citi & rsquo ; s palestinian resid lack isra citizenship and have onli resid right . those right are condit and can easili be remov , she explain , ad that thi insecur statu domin mani aspect of their live , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; everyth is condit . they may not leav the citi ; they may lose their resid statu . they can not build in the citi , but they have to live in the citi , or they lose all their entitl to the citi , & rdquo ; oppenheim said . & nbsp ; palestinian have individu right in jerusalem but not collect one , she said . & nbsp ; oppenheim dismiss claim that the palestinian are to blame for thi situat becaus they refus to take citizenship . & ldquo ; thi is an urban legend , & rdquo ; she said . palestinian were never offer collect citizenship , but rather the right to appli individu and that applic is veri complic . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; it take year and mani are deni , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; those who do not want citizenship should be offer perman resid that can not be easili revok , so that they can live their live more secur , she said . & nbsp ; the issu of inequ is the main issu , she said , and that issu is separ from the final polit statu of jerusalem , which need to be negoti between isra and palestinian , she explain . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; so is the citi unit ? & rdquo ; she ask . it & rsquo ; s those who speak so highli of uniti that seem to want it the least , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; do they realli want for jerusalem to be unit in a meaning way , in the full mean of what it mean ? becaus their action actual say the opposit , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; her organ , she said , support a two - state resolut to the conflict in which jerusalem would be the capit of both an isra and a palestinian state . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; but thi doesn & rsquo ; t mean that the citi ha to be physic divid , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; it is get more and more difficult to divid the citi . if you ask , the major of the resid actual enjoy the divers that the citi offer and do not want to see the citi divid again . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; there are creativ way to creat two capit without physic divid the citi , and the sustain of a two - state solut depend on the capac of isra and palestinian to share the municip public space in the fullest way possibl , oppenheim said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; the issu is not about divid the citi but about share it , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; we are actual work veri hard not for a vision of divid or unit , but for a vision of share citi , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; abu diab said it is clear to him that the citi is divid . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the food is differ , even the dream are differ , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; here they [ palestinian ] know they are live under occup , & rdquo ; said abu diab who doe not consid himself unifi with the jewish resid of the citi . & ldquo ; we think they are not live with us and that they want to live without us , & rdquo ; he ad . & nbsp ; he ha never sought isra citizenship , nor doe he want it . he dream of be a citizen of a futur palestinian state in which east jerusalem will be it capit . but thi doesn & rsquo ; t mean he imagin that a wall would divid the citi , but , rather , that the citi would be govern by two differ entiti , with it citizen walk freeli between both . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; jerusalem belong to everyon . it should be a citi of love and peac and nonviol . it should be an intern citi , but allow for everyon to be part of their own peopl , & rdquo ; he explain . & nbsp ; sara haetzni - cohen , who chair the right - wing ngo my israel movement , said that obvious jerusalem is israel & rsquo ; s unit capit and , as such , all effort must be made to ensur that thi is true in practic and not just a slogan . & nbsp ; to make that happen , she said , the issu of inequ between the eastern and western part of the citi must be address and it must be the right that lead that charg . & nbsp ; failur to do that , she said , give an erron messag that isra sovereignti in east jerusalem is temporari . there is littl reason to invest in neighborhood that will one day be given away . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; israel ha to make a statement of sovereignti by normal it treatment of those neighborhood , includ offer isra citizenship to the palestinian who seek it , she said . & nbsp ; otherwis , palestinian have the feel they are temporari here , haetzni - cohen said . & nbsp ; from the start , israel made a decis to appli sovereignti to the citi , and now it should shore up that sovereignti , she said . & nbsp ; to not recogn thi realiti , she said , is to & ldquo ; put one & rsquo ; s head in the sand . & rdquo ;
