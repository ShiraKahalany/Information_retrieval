is it all talk or will he actual do someth that will give us a greater sens of secur ? & rdquo ; he point out that ramot is a primarili haredi area . & ldquo ; we don & rsquo ; t consid ourselv settler ; there is no settler conscious here . thi is happen to us , and what is the respons from our rabbi and [ haredi ] politician ? noth . just to pray . of cours we need to , but we also need polici . & rdquo ; pfeffer lament the imbal between mk and rabbi , who & ldquo ; can speak up on religi matter & ndash ; which are import & ndash ; but so are peopl & rsquo ; s live . if you have the privileg to be in power , you can not sit on the sidelin . it is up to [ the politician ] to come up with some type of polici . & rdquo ; arab who live in east jerusalem chose to remain anonym when speak with the magazin . one said that he think that & ldquo ; the silent major of east jerusalemit don & rsquo ; t like attack on civilian becaus it hurt them more than it benefit them . howev , i think the major see attack on soldier and polic as a win . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; other express outrag at the deadli shoot at the neveh ya & rsquo ; acov synagogu , say that & ldquo ; attack on those leav prayer servic is cross a line . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; yet it is evid that the gener mood among palestinian in east jerusalem and the west bank is reach a boil point . thi is especi true in east jerusalem . arab there are under complet isra sovereignti , yet lack the same servic that are avail to isra . thi includ issu surround passport and visa & ndash ; flash point , as they desir the freedom to travel and work abroad . the realiti is bleaker in west bank citi such as nablu or jenin , where mani attack come from . what happen go forward ? policymak are assess how the terror attack will impact tourism and , in turn , the economi . upward of four million peopl on averag visit jerusalem annual , with tourism a vital econom lifelin . jerusalem deputi mayor fleur hassan - nahoum , whose portfolio includ tourism , told the magazin that & ldquo ; the recent terrorist attack have shaken our whole nation and left us in mourn . i understand the fear and concern among our resid and tourist alik , but jerusalem is a citi of strength and resili . & ldquo ; it ha face and overcom mani challeng in the past , and these act of terror will not defin it . & rdquo ; she continu that & ldquo ; necessari measur have been taken to ensur safeti and secur . i am confid that jerusalem will continu to thrive and attract visitor from around the world . & rdquo ; how to respond on an individu level is a question on the mind of mani . ben - gvir ha push for expedit gun licens for civilian , point to the fact that mani terrorist are stop quickli by arm isra . those interview echo thi sentiment , express a desir to obtain a licens and purchas a gun . some are even carri deterr such as pepper spray or knive . elia said he ha purchas pepper spray for himself and hi famili ; other said they keep an eye out for potenti danger situat . & nbsp ; arguabl , the most frighten realiti about the current attack is just how unpredict they can be . unlik in the past , when attack were often carri out by central terror group , today & rsquo ; s terrorist may have no prior histori of crimin behavior , yet find themselv so radic that they take up arm . & nbsp ; these type of & ldquo ; lone wolf & rdquo ; terrorist have sprung up across the world and are also a challeng for israel & rsquo ; s polic forc . though there is a common profil of these attack & ndash ; singl and unemploy & ndash ; the provoc rhetor in the mosqu and the prolifer of hate messag on social media are also incit brutal attack on civilian , young and old . where thi is lead to is anyon & rsquo ; s guess . will it spiral into an all - out third intifada as some predict ? though mani hope not , the possibl is nevertheless be discuss . even the smallest of perceiv provoc , such as ariel sharon & rsquo ; s 2000 visit to the templ mount , can spiral out of control and be the catalyst of wide - scale disturb . levi point out that the lack of action or chang in the polit realm ensur that the statu quo of terror will continu . & ldquo ; our polit figur have not been pursu the chang that we need . & rdquo ; as a result , & ldquo ; it make no sens that children should have to be kill by a ram at a bu stop befor shabbat or that older peopl should be kill as they exit a synagogu after prayer . & rdquo ; elia believ politician like ben - gvir and financ minist bezalel smotrich are aim for escal , as & ldquo ; it can help reach a determin in the conflict . & rdquo ; in ani case , it is clear from these discuss that despit the uptick in violenc , no one is make plan to leav the countri . thi is their home , nowher els . with that in mind , no amount of attack can stop peopl from continu to move to the capit and start famili . ï€¼
