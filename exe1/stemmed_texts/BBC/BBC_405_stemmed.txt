the unit nation ha revis down the figur it publish for the proport of women and children kill in gaza , lead to claim fewer palestinian have been kill sinc israel launch it offens follow the hama attack of 7 octob . on 6 may , the un said that 69 % of report fatal were women and children . two day later , it said thi figur wa 52 % . the overal number of report death in gaza - which current stand at more than 35 , 000 - ha not chang , but the un now say incomplet inform ha led to the revis . the un say it is now reli on figur from the hama - run health ministri in gaza , rather than from the hama - run govern media offic ( gmo ) . the isra foreign minist highlight the un ' s chang , call the lower report death toll for women and children `` the miracul resurrect of the dead in gaza `` and accus the un of reli on `` fake data from a terrorist organis `` . the figur have been releas in differ way by the two separ author - the gmo and the health ministri - and the un ha now switch from quot the former to the latter to break down demograph data . at the start of the war the health ministri onli report death for which detail had been regist in hospit , wherea from novemb , the gmo includ an addit categori of death record in `` reliabl media report `` . more recent the health ministri ha includ these media report compil by the gmo , along with an addit categori of death record by famili member by fill in an onlin form . gaza ' s health ministri is now therefor report these figur : some of these for which inform is miss ( such as an id number or date of birth ) are includ in the overal number of death in the health ministri figur , but are not broken down demograph . the number of women and children kill is deepli contest becaus it is often interpret as an indic of the number of civilian death . in a recent interview , isra prime minist benjamin netanyahu said about 30 , 000 peopl had been kill in gaza , with 14 , 000 of them be `` terrorist `` and 16 , 000 civilian . he did not provid ani evid for those figur . keep precis record of casualti dure wartim is challeng , so it is therefor not unusu for the number report to vari , accord to prof erica charter who specialis in the studi of war . the initi figur for how mani peopl were kill in hama ' s 7 octob attack wa origin put at 1 , 400 by isra author , but wa later revis down to about 1 , 200 . at the time , the isra author said the misidentif of some of the burnt bodi wa the reason for the discrep . the gmo ha consist given a higher figur for the proport of women and children in all fatal than ha the health ministri . on 6 may , the un report 34 , 735 death - of which there were 9 , 500 women and 14 , 500 children , cite the gmo as it sourc . the two day later , the un releas a further report , switch it sourc to the health ministri . the result of thi wa that although the overal record death toll wa almost unchang ( 34 , 844 ) , the number of regist death of women ( 4 . 959 ) and children ( 7 , 797 ) had both fallen significantli . thi differ wa becaus those individu with incomplet inform were not includ in the demograph breakdown . the gmo say the proport of women and children kill in the conflict is around 70 % . the un ' s latest report , cite health ministri data , say out of 24 , 686 fulli identifi fatal , 52 % were women and children , 40 % were men , and 8 % were `` elderli `` , without specifi whether they were male or femal . it isn ' t clear what age the report consid to be `` elderli `` and how it categoris children . we have done our own analysi of detail data releas by the health ministri , and also found that 52 % of the fatal were list as women and children ( anyon under 18 ) . in addit , 43 % were men and anoth 5 % were `` unknown `` ( miss inform such as an age or gender ) . for the gmo ' s figur to be compat with the health ministri ' s data , almost all of the 10 , 000 death not fulli identifi by the ministri would have to have been women and children . `` it ' s not logic imposs ... but it realli strain credibl , '' say prof michael spagat , who specialis in examin death toll in conflict around the world . we ask the gmo whi the proport of women and children they have record as kill is so much higher than in the health ministri ' s data , but they did not provid a direct respons to the discrep . we also approach the health ministri for comment . prof spagat also told the bbc that the death toll in gaza wa `` staggeringli high `` given the war ha onli been go on for six month , note that the verifi hospit death still repres about 1 % of gaza ' s pre - war popul of 2 . 4 million . ask by bbc verifi whi it made the chang , the un said it use the gmo data for women and children kill becaus the health ministri had not been publish these figur . `` onc the ministri of health in gaza publish breakdown that were more comprehens , back up by a list of name , the un report reflect that data instead , '' a un spokesman said . he ad that in both case , the figur were attribut to their sourc and a `` clear note `` wa ad make clear the un ' s `` inabl to present provid an independ confirm of the data `` . the un ha previous said that it ha a `` long - stand co - oper `` with the gaza health ministri , and that it previou report ha been consid credibl and `` well develop `` . data analysi by rob england and daniel wainwright what do you want bbc verifi to investig ?
