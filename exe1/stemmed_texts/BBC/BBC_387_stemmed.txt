report alway carri some kind of baggag with them when they head off to cover a stori - whether it ' s the tool of their trade , a camera or a microphon , or someth less tangibl , such as memori of a past encount or stori . it wa on a recent deploy that the bbc ' s middl east analyst sebastian usher suddenli notic that the often unwant companion that seemingli alway accompani him on trip abroad had suddenli gone miss . i got back from a report trip to jerusalem , with all the usual high and low , and with the backdrop of one of the world ' s most utterli enthral citi . and i realis on my return that someth that habitu accompani me on such trip had been miss . someth that i have alway somewhat resent , yet also jealous guard as an essenti part of who i am . my stutter . even after all these year it is almost alway there , just give a littl wave as i prepar to do the umpteenth live interview . it ' s mostli veri well - behav these day and surprisingli flexibl , even gener . at one time , it would let me know that a certain word - say , `` syria `` - wa a no - go . that wa fair and mostli allow me a way around it . it had no object , for instanc , to `` syrian territori `` or the `` syrian region `` . have to find fresh phrase can be an asset for a report . so it wa perfectli liveabl - with and to be honest - after a lifetim of listen to that littl voic - quit companion . but high up on the windswept bureau balconi in jerusalem , the voic wa silent . there have been time like thi befor , and it ha alway return . but who know - thi time it might be for good . and it make me feel a littl bereft . when i look back , i can ' t realli rememb how it start but i do know that it wa - to me at least - a rel unobtrus part of my childhood . i wa lucki to have a rel shelter , privileg upbring where if it wa note at all , it wa seen as a vagu charm mark of distinct . a musti old classic teacher would tell me about the great athenian rhetorician demosthen stand on the beach with stone in hi mouth to cure hi stutter . it didn ' t realli appeal . ani time there wa some distanc that need to be bridg - like speak on a phone or ask for a bu ticket - it could be a problem . anyth too formal , too . and i found earli on that it wa realli a stammer , not a stutter . word didn ' t fractur and becom staccato . they simpli sat in the path like great unblink toad , slyli prevent anyth from get past . but a stutter alway sound classier to me , so i ' ve stuck with that . it ' s been everywher with me - at school , univers , work . it ' s been quit remark even - hand in show up in formal or casual situat . and utterli caprici , suddenli come up with an entir new syllabl or conson to place out of bound . peopl would ask : is it nerv ? are you veri anxiou ? which would of cours give me anxieti - so i never mention it . thi meant that if suddenli , halfway through a sentenc , i wa struck dumb , peopl would react as if it were some biblic curs . onc in jordan after a 12 - hour bu journey through the endless scrubland from riyadh , i wa suddenli unabl to sound out a singl word , a great imaginari boulder have materialis on my tongu through the night . across the middl east , beyond the endless strife and complic , certain thing were at least clear to me - `` lebanon `` wa no problem , `` iraq `` and `` iran `` were easi - `` israel `` too - `` egypt `` a doddl - but `` tunisia `` , `` tel aviv `` and `` turkey `` were temperament , withdraw access at a moment ' s notic . i would tri to avoid listen to a fellow correspond on the same stori befor go on air , in case my inner voic should triumphantli extric the key word from their report and place it in quarantin . that voic ha howev becom ever more forgiv and forbear down the year ; now it is mostli a whisper of itself . but it ' s never gone away - or so i thought . mayb i wa just hold onto it as a preciou fragment of a long - lost self - a sens that there wa alway someth latent and untap that lay beyond the surfac . a connect - semi secret - to entir world of peopl that were gone . as she sank ever deeper into alzheim ' s , my mother , who had help make it so that i never felt it a burden or a hindranc , simpli deni outright that my stutter had ever exist - a last link broken with the past . perhap it ' s her gentl and eleg humour that the trace of sudden silenc on my tongu still keep aliv . or did . so , the next time i am lost for word , it may simpli be becaus there are none left to convey what is happen in gaza , israel and beyond .
